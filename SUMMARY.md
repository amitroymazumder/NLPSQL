🏦 OTC Ops Copilot – End-to-End Architecture & Plan
🔹 Core Problem You’re Solving

Ops teams in banks spend hours:

Extracting data manually (SQL/Excel).

Reconciling confirmations, netting exceptions, settlement fails.

Preparing daily/weekly reports.

Building dashboards in Excel/PowerBI with lag.

Your solution = “AI Ops Copilot” that:

Understands natural language questions.

Generates accurate SQL (against MS SQL).

Displays live dashboards & visualizations.

Automates scheduled reports (daily/weekly extracts).

Logs everything for audit/compliance.

🔹 Key Modules & Workflow

NL → SQL Engine (Vanna++)

User asks question in plain English.

LLM generates SQL.

SQL runs against MS SQL → result returned.

📦 Tech Stack:

Custom LLM connector (for your in-house LLM or Groq API).

pyodbc for MS SQL connection.

ChromaDB (or another vector DB) for storing schema/business rules.

LangGraph (optional future) → multi-step reasoning.

LlamaIndex (optional future) → schema/document ingestion for context.

🎯 Purpose: Allow ops to self-serve without writing SQL.

Mandatory Training Module

Enforces schema + glossary + business rules before use.

Optional: upload custom queries/docs.

Versioned training profiles for rollback.

📦 Tech Stack:

Python scripts to auto-ingest DB schema.

Glossary YAML/JSON files for banking terms.

ChromaDB for embeddings.

🎯 Purpose: Ensure tool has baseline context → better accuracy.

Interactive Q&A UI

Web app where user asks questions.

Results shown as table + chart.

User can download results as CSV.

📦 Tech Stack:

Streamlit (MVP, fast to build).

(Future) Next.js + React for enterprise-grade UI.

Plotly for interactive visualizations.

🎯 Purpose: Simple UI → Ops can interact like chat, not like coders.

Dashboard Module

User saves a query as a widget.

Dashboard refreshes query results daily/in real-time.

Visualizations update automatically.

📦 Tech Stack:

Plotly for charts (bar, line, pie, scatter).

Streamlit autorefresh for real-time updates.

SQL + JSON configs for widget storage.

🎯 Purpose: Turn ad-hoc questions into live dashboards.

Extract Manager (Scheduled Reports)

Save query as report template.

Schedule frequency (daily, weekly, custom).

Deliver via email/Slack/Teams/SharePoint.

Logs all executions.

📦 Tech Stack:

APScheduler (lightweight scheduling, MVP).

Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ (enterprise-grade job scheduling).

ReportLab / WeasyPrint for PDF exports.

smtplib / SendGrid API for email delivery.

Webhooks for Slack/Teams.

🎯 Purpose: Automate repetitive reports → Ops don’t have to “ask” every day.

Audit & Compliance Layer

Log every question, SQL generated, execution time, and result.

Store in separate audit DB.

Exportable for compliance reviews.

📦 Tech Stack:

MS SQL audit table or Postgres/SQLite (depending on deployment).

Python logging middleware.

🎯 Purpose: Banks require full traceability of AI-driven actions.

🔹 Two Deployment Options

Lightweight (Plug-and-Play)

All modules inside one Streamlit app.

APScheduler for job scheduling.

SQLite/JSON for widget + report storage.

Target: SMEs, smaller banks.

Enterprise (Modular / Microservices)

Separate Scheduler Service (Celery + Redis).

Report configs in central DB.

UI (Streamlit/Next.js) talks to scheduler via API.

Logs integrated into Splunk/ELK.

Target: Investment banks, large-scale ops.

🔹 End Vision (Pitch to Clients)

You’re building:
💼 “Ops Copilot for Banks” – an AI tool that:

Understands ops data (trades, netting, settlements).

Answers questions instantly in plain English.

Monitors KPIs live via dashboards.

Delivers scheduled reports automatically.

Keeps a full audit trail for compliance.

✅ Tech Stack Recap

Frontend/UI: Streamlit (MVP), Next.js/React (future).

Backend: Python (FastAPI if needed for APIs).

Database connectors: pyodbc (MS SQL).

LLM: In-house / Groq / open-source (LLM connector).

Vector Store: ChromaDB (schema, glossary, docs).

Visualization: Plotly (charts) + Streamlit native.

Scheduling: APScheduler (MVP), Celery/Airflow (enterprise).

Reports: Pandas (CSV/Excel), WeasyPrint (PDF).

Delivery: Email (SMTP/SendGrid), Slack/Teams (webhooks).

Audit: SQL/NoSQL logs.

👉 You’re basically building a Palantir Foundry-lite, laser-focused on OTC trade lifecycle + ops automation, but at a fraction of the cost and complexity.
