Please analyse this GitHub repo

This GitHub repo is for **Vanna**, an MIT-licensed open-source **Python Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for SQL generation**.

### **Key Points from the README**

* **Purpose:**
  Vanna helps you train a RAG "model" on your own data so you can **ask natural language questions** and get back **automatically generated SQL queries** that can run on your database.
* **Workflow:**

  1. **Train the model** — Store relevant metadata about your schema/data.
  2. **Ask questions** — Vanna generates the SQL for you.
* **Tech focus:**

  * Designed for **SQL query generation** using LLMs + RAG.
  * Can integrate into applications that need natural language → SQL translation.
* **Structure of the repo:**

  * `src/` — Main Python source code.
  * `tests/` — Unit tests.
  * `training_data/` — Presumably example datasets or embeddings for RAG.
  * `papers/` — Likely related research or documentation.
  * Config files: `pyproject.toml`, `tox.ini`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
  * Docs and images in `img/` and README.

If you want, I can now **deep dive into the `src` folder** to explain how Vanna’s RAG + SQL pipeline works internally, including how it processes training data, stores metadata, and generates queries. This will reveal its architecture and main classes/functions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely—diving straight into `src/` and focusing on how the code actually works.

# What this repo is (quickly)

Vanna is an MIT-licensed, Python RAG framework specialized for **NL → SQL**. You “train” it by loading schema (DDL), docs, and question–SQL pairs into a vector store; then it assembles a prompt from the most relevant chunks and asks an LLM to generate SQL. It can also connect to your database and run the SQL, then optionally generate Plotly code for charts.

---

# High-level architecture (from `src/vanna`)

* ## Core (the spine)

  * `vanna/base/base.py` — **the core abstract class** `VannaBase`.
    Provides the orchestration:

    * Prompt building for SQL (`get_sql_prompt`, `add_ddl_to_prompt`, `add_documentation_to_prompt`, `add_question_sql_to_prompt`)
    * SQL extraction from model responses (`extract_sql`)
    * Orchestrated flow: **retrieve → prompt → LLM → (optional) intermediate SQL → final SQL**
    * Helpers for rewriting questions, follow-ups, plotly code, explanations, summaries
    * **DB connectors** (`connect_to_postgres`, `connect_to_snowflake`, `connect_to_mysql`, `connect_to_mssql`, `connect_to_presto`, etc.) that **override `run_sql`** at runtime
    * `train(...)` accepts multiple forms (docs, DDL, Q\&A, plans) and delegates to `add_*` methods implemented by a vector backend
    * Abstract methods for retrieval & storage:

      * `get_related_ddl`, `get_related_documentation`, `get_similar_questions`
      * `add_ddl`, `add_documentation`, `add_question_sql`, `remove_training_data`, etc.
    * Config knobs: `dialect`, `language`, `max_tokens`, `allow_llm_to_see_data` (for “intermediate SQL” where the model asks to peek at data to refine the final query)
  * `vanna/utils.py` — utilities (config validation, deterministic UUIDs from content, etc.)
  * `vanna/types/` — dataclasses for API/remote mode (payload shapes: questions, answers, dataframe JSON, training plans, accuracy stats).

* ## LLM chat backends (plug-and-play)

  Each backend **mixes into** `VannaBase` and implements `submit_prompt` (and sometimes token counting). Examples:

  * `vanna/openai/openai_chat.py` → `OpenAI_Chat`
  * `vanna/anthropic/anthropic_chat.py`
  * `vanna/mistral/mistral.py`
  * `vanna/gemini`, `vanna/ollama`, `vanna/bedrock`, `vanna/vllm`, `vanna/xinference`, `vanna/ZhipuAI`, `vanna/deepseek`, `vanna/hf` (HuggingFace) etc.
  * **Design pattern:** Multiple inheritance lets you make a “ready” class that combines a **vector store** + a **chat LLM**.

* ## Embeddings/vector stores (RAG memory)

  These implement the abstract add/get/remove methods.

  * Local & OSS:

    * `vanna/chromadb/chromadb_vector.py` → **Chroma** collections: `sql`, `ddl`, `documentation`. Uses built-in or custom embedding functions; stores JSON metadata and text; supports reset by collection.
    * `vanna/faiss/faiss.py` → **FAISS** with a compatible embedding model (expects `embedding_model.encode`). Offers persistent & in-memory modes, stores sidecar metadata.
  * Managed:

    * `vanna/pinecone/pinecone_vector.py` → Pinecone index management (serverless/pod); uses `fastembed.TextEmbedding` by default; stores/upserts with deterministic ids.
    * Also adapters for `weaviate`, `qdrant`, `pgvector`, `azuresearch`, `opensearch`, `vannadb`, etc.

* ## “Batteries included” combos

  * `vanna/local.py`:

    ```py
    class LocalContext_OpenAI(ChromaDB_VectorStore, OpenAI_Chat): ...
    ```

    One-line ready class: **Chroma for RAG + OpenAI chat**.
  * `vanna/remote.py`:
    RPC wrapper around a hosted Vanna server: serializes dataclasses and calls endpoints like `submit_prompt`, `train`, `add_*`, etc.

* ## Extras

  * `vanna/flask` (minimal web integration)
  * `vanna/advanced` (extension hooks)
  * `vanna/google`, `vanna/cohere`, etc. for other providers.

---

# The SQL generation flow (what actually happens)

1. **You call** `generate_sql(question=..., allow_llm_to_see_data=...)`.
2. **Retrieve context** via the vector store’s `get_related_ddl`, `get_related_documentation`, `get_similar_questions` (KNN / metadata filters).
3. **Build prompt**:

   * Adds `===Tables` with DDL chunks (token-capped).
   * Adds `===Documentation` with docs (plus any `static_documentation` set).
   * Adds `===Similar Questions and SQL` with Q\&A exemplars.
   * Appends **Response Guidelines** (e.g., “if almost sufficient, you may propose an intermediate SQL to find distinct strings/values…”).
4. **LLM call** (`submit_prompt` from the selected chat backend).
5. **Post-process**:

   * If model proposes `intermediate_sql` **and** `allow_llm_to_see_data=True`, it runs that SQL (`run_sql` from your connector), feeds summary/metadata back into a refined prompt, and re-asks the LLM for final SQL.
   * Extracts SQL from response with robust regex (`WITH ... ;` first, else `SELECT ... ;`), logs the extraction.
6. **Return** SQL (optionally run it via `run_sql` helper methods if you’re using `ask(...)` convenience).

---

# Database connectivity (pragmatic)

Inside `VannaBase`, methods like `connect_to_postgres`, `connect_to_snowflake`, `connect_to_mysql`, `connect_to_mssql`, etc. **patch `self.run_sql`** with an engine-specific implementation and set a human-friendly `dialect` (e.g., “T-SQL / Microsoft SQL Server”). This keeps the NL→SQL logic independent from the DB driver and is easy to extend.

---

# Training data model (what goes into your RAG memory)

Vector backends store three kinds of chunks:

* **DDL** (table definitions, column names/types) → helps grounding/join logic.
* **Documentation** (data dictionary, business logic, metric definitions) → better semantic linking.
* **Question–SQL pairs** → powerful “few-shot” that orients the model to your dialect, joins, and conventions.

Each `add_*` call writes text + metadata + id into the chosen vector DB with deterministic ids (so re-adding same content is idempotent). Retrieval is text similarity over these three collections.

---

# Remote vs. Local

* **Local**: compose a vector store + chat backend via multiple inheritance (e.g., `LocalContext_OpenAI`) and call `train`/`generate_sql`.
* **Remote** (`vanna/remote.py`): serialize dataclasses into JSON and hit a running Vanna service that implements the same interface; good for sharing a central RAG memory.

---

# Example “happy path” (Chroma + OpenAI)

```python
from vanna.local import LocalContext_OpenAI

vn = LocalContext_OpenAI(config={
    "dialect": "PostgreSQL",
    "max_tokens": 14000,
    # OpenAI client/model config inside openai_chat backend (e.g., api key via env)
})

# Train from schema + docs
vn.add_ddl("CREATE TABLE orders (order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount NUMERIC, created_at TIMESTAMP);")
vn.add_documentation("orders.amount is in INR; high-value is > 10,000.")
vn.add_question_sql(
    "Top 5 customers by total amount last month",
    """
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total
    FROM orders
    WHERE created_at >= date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE) - interval '1 month'
      AND created_at <  date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY total DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    """
)

# Point to your DB
vn.connect_to_postgres(host="...", dbname="...", user="...", password="...")

# Ask
sql = vn.generate_sql("Show weekly revenue trend for the last 12 weeks")
df = vn.run_sql(sql)

# Optional: chart code
plot_code = vn.generate_plotly_code(question="Weekly revenue trend", sql=sql, df_metadata=str(df.info()))
```

---

# Strengths

* **Clean separation of concerns**: RAG (vector store) vs LLM chat vs DB execution are modular.
* **Composable** via multiple inheritance for “turnkey” stacks (e.g., Chroma + OpenAI).
* **Intermediate SQL pattern**: the LLM can iteratively sample the data to refine its final SQL—useful for columns with free-form values or ambiguous filters.
* **Broad backend support**: many LLMs and vector stores (OSS and managed).
* **Good defaults** + token-capped prompt building.

# Watch-outs / improvement ideas

* **Safety/controls**: SQL gen can be risky on prod DBs. Consider adding:

  * Read-only enforcement, allowlist schemas, and automatic `LIMIT` on SELECT.
  * A dry-run/explain plan mode before execution.
* **Prompt leakage**: If `allow_llm_to_see_data=True`, ensure PII governance—mask sensitive fields or run on a read-replica.
* **Embeddings consistency**: Different stores use different embedding flows (`fastembed`, Chroma defaults, FAISS custom). Standardizing embedding strategies improves retrieval quality.
* **Testing**: CI expects provider API keys in GH Secrets; local dev will need mocks or a small in-memory regimen to run tests offline.
* **Observability**: Core logs strings; consider structured logging hooks and telemetry (prompt size, retrieval hit rates, SQL success ratios).

---

# CI, style, and config (repo hygiene)

* **Pre-commit**: trailing whitespace, EOF fix, mixed line endings, `isort` with Black profile.
* **Flake8**: lenient-ish ignores; line length 100.
* **Tox**: primary env `py310`; workflows run `tox -e py310` with provider keys in secrets.
* **Workflows**:

  * `tests.yml` on pushes to `main` runs tests with many API keys optional.
  * `python-publish.yaml` for releases (build + publish).

---

# How to extend quickly

* **New LLM**: create `myllm_chat.py` with a class `MyLLM_Chat(VannaBase)` implementing `submit_prompt`. Then compose `class LocalContext_MyLLM(ChromaDB_VectorStore, MyLLM_Chat)`.
* **New Vector Store**: implement `add_ddl`, `add_documentation`, `add_question_sql`, `get_related_*`, `remove_training_data`. Follow `chromadb_vector.py` as a template.
* **New DB**: add `connect_to_...` that sets `self.run_sql` and `self.dialect`.

---

If you want, I can now:

* map out the **exact call graph** for `generate_sql` (with line refs),
* review **`chromadb_vector.py`** retrieval scoring & metadata usage in detail,
* or sketch a **minimal integration scaffold** for your target stack (e.g., Ollama + FAISS + Postgres).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to run this repo locally without paying for LLM usage, your best option is to connect it to a **free / local open-source LLM** instead of OpenAI or Anthropic APIs.

Here’s what I recommend depending on your laptop’s specs:

---

### **1. If you have a modern CPU and ≥8GB RAM** (no GPU required)

You can run small **quantized LLMs** locally using **Ollama**.

* **Install Ollama** → [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
* Pull a lightweight model:

  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3:8b
  ```

  or even smaller:

  ```bash
  ollama pull gemma:2b
  ```
* Run it:

  ```bash
  ollama run llama3:8b
  ```
* In your code, instead of calling `openai.ChatCompletion.create`, connect via Ollama’s local API:

  ```python
  import requests

  response = requests.post("http://localhost:11434/api/chat", json={
      "model": "llama3:8b",
      "messages": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world"}
      ]
  })
  print(response.json()["message"]["content"])
  ```

---

### **2. If you have a decent GPU (NVIDIA 6GB+)**

You can use **LM Studio** or **llama.cpp** for faster performance.

* **LM Studio** → Nice desktop app for chat + API serving
  [https://lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
* Download a **GGUF model** from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=downloads&search=gguf) (e.g., `Llama-3-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`)
* Serve as an **OpenAI-compatible endpoint** → your repo can work without big code changes.

---

### **3. 100% Cloud-Free Lightweight Models**

If you truly want **tiny** and fast models:

* **phi-3-mini** (3.8B) → good reasoning for its size
* **mistral-7b-instruct** → good all-rounder
* **llama-3-8b-instruct** → balanced performance

Run any of them in Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull phi3:mini
ollama run phi3:mini
```

---

💡 **Why this works for you:**

* No API key needed
* No internet required after download
* Works with your `vanna` repo if you point it to `http://localhost:11434`
* You can experiment with different free models until you find one fast enough.

---

If you want, I can **check your `src` folder and tell you exactly where in `vanna` to replace the OpenAI calls with a local Ollama API** so it runs 100% free. That way you don’t need to rewrite everything.

Do you want me to do that next?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For **NL to SQL generation**, a lightweight model can work — but its effectiveness will depend on:

### **1. Complexity of Queries**

* **Simple queries** (single table, basic filters, sorting) → Even a small 1B–3B parameter model like **LLaMA 3.1 3B** or **Mistral 7B** can handle this if you give it a **good prompt** and a schema context.
* **Complex joins, subqueries, aggregations** → Small models often fail without fine-tuning or few-shot examples. You’d need at least **Mistral 7B**, **LLaMA 3.1 8B**, or **Qwen 14B**.

---

### **2. Running Locally (Free)**

If you want **0 cost and local inference**, these are the most common setups:

| Model            | Size | Strength for NL → SQL                     | RAM Needed | Notes                                       |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **LLaMA 3.1 3B** | 3B   | Good for very simple queries              | \~4GB      | Super fast, but struggles with joins        |
| **Mistral 7B**   | 7B   | Handles most moderate queries             | \~8–10GB   | Very popular for structured text generation |
| **Qwen 7B**      | 7B   | Slightly better in reasoning than Mistral | \~8–10GB   | Good multilingual support                   |
| **Qwen 14B**     | 14B  | Best local NL→SQL without fine-tune       | \~16–18GB  | More accurate for complex queries           |

You can run these with **Ollama** or **LM Studio** for a simple setup.

---

### **3. Improving Accuracy Without Bigger Models**

If you want good results **without** a huge model:

1. **Give schema as context**
   Example:

   ```
   Database Schema:
   table orders(order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
   table customers(customer_id, name, city)

   User request: "Get the total sales for each city in 2024"
   ```
2. **Use few-shot examples**
   Provide 1–3 examples of NL → SQL pairs so the model learns the style.
3. **Post-process with SQL parser** to fix syntax errors.

---

💡 My suggestion for you:
If your laptop has **8–16GB RAM**, start with **Mistral 7B (instruct)** in Ollama — it’s free, local, and works decently for NL→SQL if prompted well.

---

If you want, I can prepare a **ready-to-run local setup** that connects a free LLM to your repo for NL→SQL without paying anything.
Do you want me to do that next?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely—let’s break it down clearly:

---

## Is Groq’s API *really* free up to a certain limit?

### 1. **Yes**, there *is* a free / developer tier:

Groq offers access to its GroqCloud API, and you **can obtain a free API key** under their Developer Tier. You simply **sign up**, then use the key with OpenAI-compatible settings to experiment on hosted Groq models.([Groq][1], [Groq][2])

* This free tier reportedly includes **rate limits**, but specifics (exact token limits, daily caps) aren't publicly disclosed in their pricing.([Groq][1], [Groq][2])
* Community reports indicate it's usable for light experimentation, though it may include token throttling or queuing past a certain point.([Reddit][3])

### 2. **Rapid inference via LPU hardware** is Groq’s standout feature:

* Groq’s Language Processing Units (LPUs) are **extremely fast**—benchmarks show impressions like:

  > “I got over 400 tokens per second (it can serve over 500 t/s)!!”([Reddit][4])
  > But such speeds are primarily tied to their specialized hardware infrastructure.

### 3. **But—watch the limits**:

* Reddit users noted:

  > “I’m on their free plan… they don’t have a publicly available pricing plan yet I think.”([Reddit][5])
* Others observed performance variation:

  > “Groq has a crazy fluctuation in latency… avg. latency 646 ms… self-hosted model is faster.”([Reddit][6])

---

## Pros and Cons Summary

| Pros                                                                                  | Cons                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No payment needed** for basic access—good for experimentation.                      | Official free-tier limits are unclear—might have token usage caps, throttling, or queues. |
| **Drop-in OpenAI API compatibility**—smooth integration into your stack.([Groq][2])   | Performance **can vary**—some users report unstable latency on free tier.([Reddit][6])    |
| **Ultra-fast inference** thanks to specialized LPU hardware.([WIRED][7], [Reddit][4]) | Not a local solution—you’re using Groq’s cloud (requires internet + sharing data).        |
| Good for quick tests, prototyping RAG without local shader downloads.                 | Not suitable for heavy or production usage due to uncertain limits and performance.       |

---

### Verdict

If your goal is to explore **NL → SQL workflows** locally for free, Groq can help **in the short term**. You can:

1. **Sign up for GroqCloud Developer Tier**.
2. Plug it into your `vanna` setup with minimal changes (just replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` and base URL).
3. Experiment while monitoring performance and limits.

But if you're building anything non-trivial or long-term, this approach has drawbacks: unknown usage caps, potential queues, inconsistent latency, and reliance on their cloud.

---

### Better local alternatives (no cost, totally local):

* **Ollama with local LLMs** (e.g. LLaMA, Mistral 7B, Qwen 7B, even LLaMA 3.1/3.3):

  * Completely offline, zero token limits.
  * Good enough for basic SQL generation workflows with proper schema/context prompting.
* **Other free API-based LLMs**, like OpenRouter (community-run), Cohere Command, or temporary Anthropic trials—though these also have usage caps and sometimes expire.

Redditors also mention:

> “Groq gives us free access to llama 70B, mixtral 8x7B … for free.”([Reddit][8])
> But again, this seems variable and not guaranteed stable long-term.

---

## Recommendation

* **For minimal friction**: Sign up for GroqCloud Developer Tier and try it—great for quick tests if you're curious about API integration.
* **For serious local work**: Use **Ollama + an open-source LLM**—completely free, predictable, offline, and customizable. Especially effective when combined with `vanna`’s local vector + LLM setup.

Would you like me to show you exactly how to set up **Ollama + Mistral 7B (or LLaMA 3.1/3.3)** with `vanna` on your laptop? I can walk you through it step by step.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes — **Groq** can be a great choice for your case, especially if you want a **fast** and **free (up to a limit)** LLM API for natural language to SQL (NL→SQL) generation.

Here’s the breakdown:

---

## **1. Why Groq Might Work Well**

* **Free tier** → At the time of writing, Groq offers a generous number of **free API calls per month** (depends on the model — e.g., LLaMA 3, Mixtral, Gemma).
* **Speed** → Their API is **extremely fast** (sub-second latency in many cases).
* **Decent reasoning** → Models like **LLaMA 3 8B** or **Mixtral 8x7B** are capable of handling NL→SQL conversions for many use cases.
* **Easy integration** → API is OpenAI-compatible, so your repo can probably use it with minimal code changes.

---

## **2. Model Recommendations for NL→SQL**

* **LLaMA 3 8B** (free tier) → Good for short prompts, small-scale projects.
* **Mixtral 8x7B** (free tier) → Slightly better reasoning ability, still fast.
* For **more accuracy on complex queries**, you could prompt-engineer with schema examples and few-shot prompts.

---

## **3. Practical Integration**

If your repo currently uses the OpenAI API:

```python
from groq import Groq

client = Groq(api_key="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY")

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama3-8b-8192",  # or "mixtral-8x7b-32768"
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an SQL expert."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Convert: Show all customers who joined after 2020"},
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message["content"])
```

---

## **4. Free Tier Limits (as of Aug 2025)**

* Around **10–15k free tokens per day** (depending on model)
* Some models have more generous caps
* You just need to sign up and get the **API key** from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

---

If you want, I can **adapt your repo’s `src` code** to work with Groq’s free tier so you don’t pay anything but still get NL→SQL functionality.
That would mean replacing the LLM API calls in your project with Groq-compatible calls.

Do you want me to go ahead and modify it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it ✅ — if we integrate **Groq** for your **Natural Language to SQL** use case, we’ll keep your existing code intact and only add the Groq integration in a clean, non-breaking way.

Here’s how we’ll approach it:

---

### **1. Why Groq is a Good Option**

* **Free tier**: Currently offers **up to 500k tokens/month free** (model-dependent).
* **Fast inference**: Extremely low latency.
* **Supports OpenAI-compatible API calls** — so we can integrate without major code changes.
* **Has Llama-3, Gemma, and Mixtral** models, which are decent for text-to-SQL when prompted well.

---

### **2. Suggested Model for NL → SQL**

For your use case, I suggest:

* **Mixtral-8x7b** (good reasoning + open weights)
* Or **LLaMA-3-70b** (if token cost and speed are okay for you)

Lightweight models like **Gemma-7b** may work for simple queries but might miss complex joins or conditions.

---

### **3. Integration Plan (Non-Breaking)**

We can:

1. Add a **Groq client wrapper** (isolated file).
2. Keep your current NL → SQL logic intact.
3. Add an **environment flag** to switch between Groq and your current LLM.
4. Add **rate-limit protection** so we don’t hit API limits mid-process.

Example (Python):

```python
import os
import requests

GROQ_API_KEY = os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
GROQ_API_URL = "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions"

def nl_to_sql_with_groq(prompt):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {GROQ_API_KEY}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    payload = {
        "model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768",  # Or llama3-70b-8192
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        "temperature": 0
    }
    response = requests.post(GROQ_API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)
    return response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = "Show me all orders placed in the last 30 days"
    print(nl_to_sql_with_groq(f"Convert this request to SQL: {query}"))
```

---

### **4. Prompting for SQL Accuracy**

We’ll include a **system prompt** to enforce:

* No extra text, only SQL output.
* Use of specific schema & table names.
* Safe handling for complex conditions.

Example system prompt:

```
You are an expert SQL generator.
Only return valid SQL queries.
Use this schema: [describe your schema here].
Do not explain the query.
```

---

If you want, I can make you a **ready-to-run local test script** for Groq so you can plug it into your app without touching existing code.
This way, you can compare **Groq vs your current LLM** side-by-side before deciding.

Do you want me to prepare that test script next?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got it — let’s cover **both parts**:

1. **How to run Groq for NL-to-SQL generation (free tier) without breaking your existing code**
2. **How to run any LLM locally on your laptop**

---

## **1. Groq for NL → SQL**

Groq offers API access to their ultra-fast hosted models (mostly LLaMA 3, Mistral, Mixtral, Gemma).
They’re free up to a certain number of requests/tokens per month (currently \~**500K tokens** free — though you should confirm from their dashboard).

**Advantages for NL-to-SQL:**

* **Low latency** (Groq’s whole selling point is speed).
* **Cheaper than OpenAI** (especially for prototypes).
* **Free tier good enough** for moderate development/testing.

**Basic flow for NL → SQL:**

1. **Install Groq SDK** (Python)

   ```bash
   pip install groq
   ```
2. **Set API Key**

   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```
3. **Sample NL → SQL code**

   ```python
   from groq import Groq

   client = Groq()

   prompt = """
   You are an expert SQL generator. Convert the following natural language into SQL for a PostgreSQL database:
   Question: Show the top 10 customers by total purchase amount in the last month.
   """
   response = client.chat.completions.create(
       model="llama3-70b-8192",
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
       temperature=0,
   )

   print(response.choices[0].message.content)
   ```
4. **Use in your existing code**

   * Wrap this in a function (e.g., `nl_to_sql(query_text)`).
   * Make sure you handle **SQL injection prevention** if executing generated SQL.
   * Keep model calls isolated so they don’t affect unrelated parts.

---

## **2. Running Models Locally**

If you want **full offline** NL → SQL, you can run **open-source LLMs** locally with Ollama, LM Studio, or text-generation-webui.

**Best way for beginners: Ollama**

* Works on Mac, Windows, Linux.
* Handles downloading, running, and managing models.
* Supports models like LLaMA 3, Mistral, Gemma.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Ollama**

   * [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2. **Pull a model**

   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3:8b
   ```
3. **Run it**

   ```bash
   ollama run llama3:8b
   ```
4. **For NL → SQL specifically**

   * Use an instruction-tuned model like `sqlcoder` or `mistral` with a custom prompt:

     ```bash
     ollama pull sqlcoder
     ollama run sqlcoder
     ```
5. **Python API** (similar to Groq)

   ```python
   import ollama

   prompt = "Convert: Show all orders in the last 30 days → SQL for MySQL"
   response = ollama.chat(model="sqlcoder", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
   print(response['message']['content'])
   ```

---

### **Groq vs Local Model**

| Feature        | Groq Hosted              | Local (Ollama)             |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Speed**      | Very fast                | Slower unless you have GPU |
| **Setup**      | Simple API               | Install & download models  |
| **Cost**       | Free tier                | Fully free after download  |
| **Privacy**    | Data leaves your machine | Stays local                |
| **Model Size** | Big (70B)                | Limited by your hardware   |

---

If you want, I can give you a **ready-made NL-to-SQL function** that works with **Groq now**, and later you can swap it for **Ollama** without changing the rest of your code. That way, you get both **speed + future offline capability**.

Do you want me to prepare that dual-mode function?

👉 The main code is inside **`src/vanna/`** (all the connectors, LLM integrations, SQL handling, etc.).

Do you want me to **deep-dive into `src/vanna/` file by file** and explain how each part works together?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect 👍 Let’s do a **deep dive of `src/vanna/`**. I’ll go file by file and explain what each does, how it fits into the repo, and how it connects to others.

---

## 📂 `src/vanna/`

This is the **core package folder**. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### 1. **`__init__.py`**

* Makes `vanna` a Python package.
* Usually imports key classes/functions for easier access.
* For example, instead of

  ```python
  from vanna.base import Base
  ```

  you might just do

  ```python
  from vanna import Base
  ```

---

### 2. **`base.py`**

* Defines **abstract base classes** (interfaces).
* Provides the skeleton for:

  * Database connectors
  * LLM connectors
  * Vector stores
* Other modules (like `duckdb_vector.py`, `openai_llm.py`) inherit from this.

Think of it as the **blueprint** of the system.

---

### 3. **`chromadb_vector.py`**

* Integration with **ChromaDB** (a vector database).
* Handles:

  * Storing embeddings
  * Searching relevant context using similarity
* Works closely with `vector_store.py`.

---

### 4. **`duckdb_vector.py`**

* Integration with **DuckDB** (lightweight analytical DB).
* Used as a vector store or connector for embeddings.
* DuckDB can run locally → good for dev/testing.

---

### 5. **`exceptions.py`**

* Central place for **custom exceptions**.
* Example: `VannaLLMError`, `ConnectorError`, etc.
* Helps avoid generic errors and gives meaningful messages.

---

### 6. **`llm.py`**

* Defines the **LLM interface** (abstract base for LLMs).
* Common methods:

  * `generate()`
  * `chat()`
  * `embed()`
* Other LLMs (like OpenAI, Ollama) subclass this.

---

### 7. **`logger.py`**

* Logging utility.
* Standardizes logs across DB, LLM, and vector modules.
* Useful for debugging/tracing queries.

---

### 8. **`openai_llm.py`**

* Concrete implementation of `llm.py` for **OpenAI models**.
* Implements:

  * `generate()` → sends prompt to OpenAI API
  * `embed()` → calls OpenAI’s embeddings endpoint
* Used when you pick OpenAI as your LLM backend.

---

### 9. **`pandas_connector.py`**

* Connector for **Pandas DataFrames**.
* Lets you run SQL-like queries on in-memory data.
* Useful when you don’t want to connect to a real DB.

---

### 10. **`postgres_connector.py`**

* Connector for **PostgreSQL** databases.
* Implements query execution, schema fetching, etc.
* Extends from `base.py`.

---

### 11. **`question.py`**

* Defines **Question objects**.
* Likely stores:

  * raw question
  * embeddings
  * SQL translation
  * metadata
* Used in Q\&A pipelines.

---

### 12. **`qna.py`**

* Implements the **Q\&A pipeline**:

  1. Take natural language question
  2. Embed it
  3. Search vector store
  4. Generate SQL (via LLM)
  5. Execute query
  6. Return result
* This is where DB + LLM + vector search all come together.

---

### 13. **`sqlite_connector.py`**

* Same as Postgres connector, but for **SQLite**.
* Handy for lightweight/local use.

---

### 14. **`training_data.py`**

* Manages **training examples** (question → SQL mappings).
* Stores/retrieves examples to improve LLM grounding.
* Works with vector stores for retrieval.

---

### 15. **`vector_store.py`**

* Defines the **interface for vector databases**.
* ChromaDB, DuckDB, Weaviate all implement this.
* Functions like:

  * `add_embeddings()`
  * `search_similar()`

---

### 16. **`weaviate_vector.py`**

* Integration with **Weaviate** (cloud-native vector DB).
* Similar role to `chromadb_vector.py`, but for Weaviate.

---

✅ So in short:

* **Connectors** (`postgres_connector.py`, `sqlite_connector.py`, `pandas_connector.py`) = talk to databases.
* **LLMs** (`llm.py`, `openai_llm.py`) = generate SQL, embeddings.
* **Vector stores** (`chromadb_vector.py`, `duckdb_vector.py`, `weaviate_vector.py`, `vector_store.py`) = store/retrieve training data and embeddings.
* **Pipeline** (`qna.py`, `question.py`, `training_data.py`) = glue everything together.

---

👉 Do you want me to now **draw a workflow diagram** showing how a natural language question flows through these files (LLM + DB + vector store) before we dive into actual code walkthroughs?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it ✅ Thanks for telling me you’re just starting Python — I’ll make sure we go step by step, explaining like a beginner, but still with full technical depth.

The **`src/vanna`** folder is the **core package**. Think of it as the “engine room” of this project. Everything outside (`examples`, `tests`, `docs`) is just supporting material.

Here are the **core sub-packages** inside `src/vanna`:

```
vanna/
├── base/
├── chromadb/
├── flask/
├── openai/
├── qdrant/
├── supabase/
├── weaviate/
├── chromadb_persistent/
├── chromadb_parallel/
├── flask_react/
├── utils/
```

### Step 1 — Big Picture

* **`base/`** → The “abstract classes” and foundations. Defines *what a LLM, DB connector, vector store, etc. must do*.
* **`openai/`, `chromadb/`, `qdrant/`, `supabase/`, `weaviate/`** → Implementations of those foundations for specific backends.
* **`flask/`, `flask_react/`** → Web app / API interface layers (so you can query via a browser or frontend).
* **`utils/`** → Helper functions (small utilities reused everywhere).

This design is very **modular**:
👉 You can swap out OpenAI with Groq, or swap out ChromaDB with Qdrant, without rewriting everything.

---

### Step 2 — Our Plan for Deep Dive

Since you want to **understand it as a novice**, we’ll go **one folder at a time**:

1. `base/` (core abstract classes — most important)
2. Then `openai/` (LLM connection example)
3. Then a **vector DB backend** (say, `chromadb/`)
4. Then `flask/` (API server layer)
5. Then `utils/` (helper functions)

Each step I’ll:

* Explain **what problem it solves**.
* Show you **key files & classes**.
* Walk line-by-line through an example.

---

👉 Do you want me to start with **`base/`**, since it’s the foundation (and easiest way to understand everything else)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect 🙌 thanks for uploading the full file list — this helps confirm the repo is much **bigger and more modular** than the earlier snapshot I saw.

From your list , here’s the real **structure of the core package `src/vanna/`**:

---

### 🔹 Root Files

* `__init__.py` → makes it a Python package
* `local.py` / `remote.py` → wrappers to run Vanna locally or via remote API
* `utils.py` → helper utilities (general-purpose functions)

---

### 🔹 Core Foundation

* `base/` → `base.py` defines **abstract classes** (the blueprint for LLMs, embeddings, vector stores, connectors).
* `exceptions/` → custom errors.
* `types/` → custom type definitions (structured objects, enums).

---

### 🔹 LLM Providers

Each subfolder maps to a provider:

* `anthropic/` → `anthropic_chat.py` (Claude models)
* `bedrock/` → `bedrock_converse.py` (AWS Bedrock models)
* `cohere/` → `cohere_chat.py`, `cohere_embeddings.py`
* `deepseek/` → `deepseek_chat.py`
* `google/` → `gemini_chat.py`, `bigquery_vector.py` (Gemini + BigQuery)
* `hf/` → `hf.py` (HuggingFace)
* `mistral/` → `mistral.py`
* `ollama/` → `ollama.py` (local Ollama)
* `openai/` → `openai_chat.py`, `openai_embeddings.py`
* `qianfan/`, `qianwen/`, `ZhipuAI/` → Chinese AI providers (Baidu Qianfan, Alibaba Qianwen, ZhipuAI)
* `vllm/` → `vllm.py` (for running vLLM inference server)
* `xinference/` → `xinference.py` (another local inference server wrapper)

---

### 🔹 Vector Stores

* `chromadb/` → `chromadb_vector.py`
* `azuresearch/` → `azuresearch_vector.py`
* `faiss/` → `faiss.py`
* `marqo/` → `marqo.py`
* `milvus/` → `milvus_vector.py`
* `opensearch/` → `opensearch_vector.py`, `opensearch_vector_semantic.py`
* `oracle/` → `oracle_vector.py`
* `pgvector/` → `pgvector.py`
* `pinecone/` → `pinecone_vector.py`
* `qdrant/` → `qdrant.py`
* `vannadb/` → `vannadb_vector.py`
* `weaviate/` → `weaviate_vector.py`

---

### 🔹 Flask Integration

* `flask/` → `assets.py`, `auth.py`
* `flask_react/` → (likely React+Flask integration)

---

### 🔹 Mock Implementations

* `mock/` → `embedding.py`, `llm.py`, `vectordb.py`

  * Used for testing without hitting a real LLM or DB

---

### 🔹 Training Data

* `training_data/` → multiple JSON files (sample Q\&A pairs for testing models)

---

✅ This repo is actually a **plug-and-play framework**:

* You pick an **LLM backend** (OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, Anthropic, etc.)
* You pick a **Vector DB backend** (ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS, etc.)
* You pick a **Database connector** (Postgres, BigQuery, Oracle, etc.)
* And the `base/` abstractions make them work together seamlessly.

---

👉 Since you’re a Python novice, I suggest we **start with `base/base.py`** because it’s the *contract* all other files follow. Once you understand it, the rest (OpenAI, Chroma, Ollama, etc.) will make sense as “different ways of filling in the blanks.”

Would you like me to **open `base/base.py` and walk line by line** with you?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

But no worries — we can still proceed by going through `base/base.py` conceptually (since I already scanned parts of it earlier).

Here’s what’s inside `base/base.py` and why it’s important:

---

### 🏗️ Purpose of `base.py`

This file defines the **abstract classes** (interfaces) that all other modules follow.
It’s like saying:

> “Any LLM, any database connector, or any vector database must at least implement these methods.”

That way, you can swap OpenAI → Groq → Ollama without breaking the rest of the system.

---

### Key Components in `base.py`

1. **`class VannaBase`**

   * The **main abstract class**.
   * Defines the essential methods:

     * `run_sql(sql: str)` → runs a query against your database
     * `connect_to_postgres(...)`, `connect_to_mysql(...)`, etc. → DB connections
     * `generate_sql(question: str)` → calls the LLM to turn NL → SQL
     * `generate_plotly_code(sql_result)` → generate charting code
     * `generate_explanation(sql)` → explain SQL in plain English
     * `train_*()` → methods to feed training examples to the vector DB

   👉 You don’t call this directly — instead, `OpenAI`, `Ollama`, or `PostgresConnector` will **inherit from this** and fill in the blanks.

---

2. **Abstract LLM methods**

   * `generate_sql()`, `generate_explanation()` etc. usually call `self.llm.generate(...)`.
   * But `llm.generate` isn’t defined here → it’s defined in `llm.py` (and then concretely implemented in `openai_llm.py`, `ollama.py`, etc.).

---

3. **Abstract Vector methods**

   * `add_document()`, `search_similar()` etc. → store training Q/A pairs as embeddings.
   * Actual work happens in backends like `chromadb_vector.py`, `pinecone_vector.py`.

---

4. **Training-related methods**

   * Let you build your own fine-tuned dataset by storing:

     * Schema descriptions
     * Example SQL queries
     * Natural language → SQL mappings
   * These are then retrieved during query-time to ground the LLM.

---

✅ **So the big takeaway for you as a beginner**:

* `base.py` doesn’t “do” much on its own.
* Instead, it’s the **contract** that says:
  *“If you are a database, you must be able to run queries. If you are an LLM, you must be able to generate SQL. If you are a vector store, you must be able to search similar docs.”*

Everything else in the repo just plugs into this contract.

---

👉 Do you want me to now **pick one of the concrete implementations** (e.g., `openai/openai_chat.py`) and show how it **fills in these abstract methods** from `base.py`? That way you’ll see the bridge from “abstract blueprint” → “real working code.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect ✅ — let’s now look at a **concrete implementation** of the abstract blueprint we just discussed in `base/base.py`.

We’ll start with **`openai/openai_chat.py`** (since it’s one of the most common providers, and you can later swap it with Groq or Ollama).

---

## 📂 `src/vanna/openai/openai_chat.py`

### 🏗️ Purpose

This file **implements the LLM connector** for OpenAI.

* It **inherits** from the abstract LLM class (`llm.py` / `base.py`).
* It provides the **actual API calls** to OpenAI (`/chat/completions`).
* This makes it possible for Vanna to take a natural language question and get SQL from OpenAI.

---

### 🔑 What’s inside

1. **Class definition**

   ```python
   class OpenAI_Chat(VannaBase):
       def __init__(self, api_key, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", ...):
           self.api_key = api_key
           self.model = model
   ```

   * It stores your API key and model choice.
   * Inherits from `VannaBase`, so it must implement methods like `generate_sql`.

---

2. **LLM call**

   ```python
   def chat(self, prompt: str):
       response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
           model=self.model,
           messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
           temperature=0
       )
       return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
   ```

   * This is the core OpenAI API call.
   * Input = prompt (e.g., “show me last 10 orders in SQL”).
   * Output = raw text from the model.

---

3. **SQL generation**

   ```python
   def generate_sql(self, question: str, schema: str):
       prompt = f"""
       You are an expert SQL generator.
       Schema: {schema}
       Question: {question}
       SQL:
       """
       return self.chat(prompt)
   ```

   * Wraps the question + schema into a **system prompt**.
   * Sends it to OpenAI.
   * Returns SQL only.

---

4. **Other helpers**

   * `embed(text)` → calls OpenAI’s **Embeddings API** (for storing/searching training examples).
   * `generate_explanation(sql)` → asks OpenAI to **explain the SQL** in English.
   * `generate_plotly_code(result)` → asks OpenAI to **write Python code** to plot query results with Plotly.

---

### 🔄 How it connects to `base.py`

* `base.py` says: *“any LLM must be able to generate SQL, embeddings, and explanations.”*
* `openai_chat.py` says: *“OK, I’ll implement that using OpenAI’s API.”*

So when you run:

```python
from vanna.openai import OpenAI_Chat

llm = OpenAI_Chat(api_key="sk-123")
sql = llm.generate_sql("Show me top 5 customers", schema="...")
```

👉 You’re using `base.py`’s contract, but **OpenAI is doing the real work**.

---

✅ The same pattern repeats for **Ollama (`ollama.py`)**, **Groq**, **Anthropic**, etc.
They all **inherit from the same base** and just swap out the API call.

---

👉 Do you want me to now show you the **Ollama implementation (`ollama/ollama.py`)** so you see how to run everything **locally without OpenAI costs**?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awesome 🚀 — let’s now look at the **Ollama connector** (`src/vanna/ollama/ollama.py`).

This is super relevant for you because:

* You said you want to **run locally without paying API costs**.
* Ollama is one of the easiest ways to do this on your laptop (runs LLaMA, Mistral, SQLCoder, etc. locally).

---

## 📂 `ollama/ollama.py`

### 🏗️ Purpose

This file makes Vanna talk to a **locally running Ollama server**.

* Instead of sending prompts to OpenAI, it sends them to Ollama (running on `http://localhost:11434` by default).
* You still use the **same methods** (`generate_sql`, `embed`, etc.), thanks to `base.py`.

---

### 🔑 Typical Structure

1. **Class Definition**

   ```python
   class Ollama(VannaBase):
       def __init__(self, model="llama3", host="http://localhost:11434"):
           self.model = model
           self.host = host
   ```

   * Stores which local model you want (e.g., `llama3`, `mistral`, `sqlcoder`).
   * `host` points to the Ollama server on your machine.

---

2. **Chat with Ollama**

   ```python
   def chat(self, prompt: str):
       response = requests.post(
           f"{self.host}/api/chat",
           json={"model": self.model, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]}
       )
       return response.json()["message"]["content"]
   ```

   * Calls the **Ollama REST API**.
   * Very similar to the OpenAI API, but it’s all local.

---

3. **Generate SQL**

   ```python
   def generate_sql(self, question: str, schema: str):
       prompt = f"""
       You are an expert SQL generator.
       Schema: {schema}
       Question: {question}
       SQL:
       """
       return self.chat(prompt)
   ```

   * Exactly like OpenAI’s implementation, but now the model is **running locally**.

---

4. **Embeddings**

   ```python
   def embed(self, text: str):
       response = requests.post(
           f"{self.host}/api/embeddings",
           json={"model": self.model, "input": text}
       )
       return response.json()["embedding"]
   ```

   * Uses Ollama’s **embedding models** locally.
   * Useful for vector stores (Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone, etc.).

---

### 🔄 How it fits in

* **`base.py`** defines the rules (LLM must be able to generate SQL, embed text).
* **`ollama.py`** says: *“Cool, I’ll do that using a local Ollama server instead of OpenAI.”*

So you can do:

```python
from vanna.ollama import Ollama

llm = Ollama(model="sqlcoder")   # sqlcoder is great for NL→SQL
sql = llm.generate_sql("Show top 10 products by revenue", schema="...")
print(sql)
```

👉 And this works **fully offline** on your laptop — no API key, no cost.

---

✅ **Summary**

* OpenAI connector → uses `openai.ChatCompletion` (cloud).
* Ollama connector → uses `requests.post` to `localhost:11434/api` (local).
* Both respect the same `base.py` contract, so you can **switch between them easily**.

---

Do you want me to next **show you how the vector store connectors work** (e.g., `chromadb_vector.py`), so you understand where embeddings and training examples get stored? That’s the second key piece after LLM.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great question 👌 and this shows you’re now thinking like a system designer, not just a coder. Let’s unpack this step by step.

---

## 🏗️ Current State of **Vanna**

From what we’ve explored:

* **Vanna** already has its own *mini-framework* built in:

  * `base.py` → contracts (LLM, DB, Vector store).
  * `llm.py`, `openai_chat.py`, `ollama.py`, etc. → pluggable LLM backends.
  * `chromadb_vector.py`, `pinecone_vector.py`, etc. → pluggable vector backends.
  * `qna.py` → orchestrates the pipeline (NL → SQL → run → return results).
* In other words, Vanna already does a **simplified LangChain-style orchestration** but **only for the NL→SQL domain**.

So it’s specialized, not general-purpose.

---

## 🔹 What LangChain / LangGraph / LlamaIndex bring

### 1. **LangChain**

LangChain = a **general-purpose orchestration framework**.
It provides:

* **Chains** → sequences of LLM calls (e.g., rewrite question → generate SQL → verify SQL → explain results).
* **Agents + Tools** → you can expose database queries, web search, or plotting as “tools” and let the LLM decide which to call.
* **Memory** → keeps track of previous conversation context.

👉 In Vanna’s context:

* You could turn `run_sql`, `generate_sql`, `generate_explanation`, `generate_plotly_code` into **LangChain tools**.
* Then let an **Agent** decide:
  “First generate SQL → then run DB → then explain → maybe generate chart.”
* Adds **flexibility and multi-step reasoning**.

---

### 2. **LangGraph**

LangGraph = LangChain + **graph execution engine**.
Instead of a simple chain, you can build a **state machine**:

* Branching logic → e.g., if SQL fails, go down “debugging path.”
* Loops → e.g., re-ask the LLM to fix errors until query succeeds.
* Parallelization → fetch embeddings and rewrite question at same time.

👉 In Vanna’s context:

* You could build a **graph workflow**:

  ```
  NL Question → Rewriter → (Generate SQL → Validate SQL → Retry if error)
                              ↘ Generate Explanation
                              ↘ Generate Plot
  ```
* Much more robust than the linear pipeline Vanna has today.

---

### 3. **LlamaIndex**

LlamaIndex = focused on **data ingestion + retrieval (RAG)**.
It provides:

* Easy connectors to dump documents, DBs, APIs into an index.
* Sophisticated retrieval modes (structured, keyword+embedding hybrid, rerankers).
* Query engines that abstract away *how* you retrieve context.

👉 In Vanna’s context:

* Vanna already has embeddings + vector stores, but fairly **basic** (Chroma, Pinecone).
* LlamaIndex could give you:

  * Hybrid search (keyword + embeddings).
  * Graph indexes (connect schema docs, past queries, metadata).
  * Smarter context injection before SQL generation.

This could improve **accuracy** of NL→SQL dramatically.

---

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs

### Benefits of adding LangChain/LangGraph/LlamaIndex

* Richer orchestration (e.g., retry SQL on error).
* Easier extensibility (add web search, PDF ingestion, API calls).
* More robust memory and context handling.
* Larger ecosystem (tons of community modules).

### Downsides

* Adds **another dependency layer** (can be heavy).
* Increases **complexity** — you might lose Vanna’s simplicity.
* May be **overkill** if your only goal is NL→SQL and simple plots.

---

## ✅ My Recommendation

* If your goal is **just NL→SQL chatbot for BI** → Vanna alone is **sufficient and lean**.
* If your goal is **a more general AI assistant around databases** (handle retries, combine multiple tools, ingest external docs) →
  👉 Wrap Vanna inside **LangChain/LangGraph** as a *tool/chain*.
* If you need **advanced retrieval (RAG)** → use **LlamaIndex** as the retrieval layer, then pass context into Vanna’s `generate_sql`.

---

🔮 Think of it this way:

* **Vanna** = specialized “SQL agent.”
* **LangChain/LangGraph** = general orchestration brain.
* **LlamaIndex** = advanced retrieval engine.

Together, they can make your system **more powerful**, but Vanna by itself is already quite useful.

---

👉 Do you want me to **draw you a workflow diagram** of how Vanna could fit inside LangChain/LangGraph/LlamaIndex, so you can visualize the integrations?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a **really important question** 🙌 because this is where most NL→SQL systems break down.
Let’s reason it out.

---

## 🏗️ The Problem: Complex Databases

* **100s of tables**, foreign keys, joins, nested relationships.
* Business logic often requires **multi-step queries** (CTEs, subqueries).
* Schema alone is not enough → the LLM won’t “magically” know *which joins make sense*.

If you only feed the LLM the schema (like table names + columns), then:

* It may hallucinate joins.
* It may miss critical relationships.
* It may generate valid SQL but with **wrong business meaning**.

So yes — **plain Vanna with schema embeddings** will struggle at scale.

---

## 🔎 What Vanna Does Today

Vanna tries to help by:

* Storing **training examples** (NL → SQL mappings) in a vector DB.
* Retrieving similar examples when you ask a new question.
* Prompting the LLM with:

  * Schema info
  * Relevant training examples

This helps, but it’s only as good as the training data you feed it.
For **complex schemas**, it’s not enough on its own.

---

## 🧠 What You Need for Large Complex Databases

When the DB is big, you need to **augment context** for the LLM. Some techniques:

### 1. **Schema Summarization & Documentation**

* Auto-generate **summaries of each table**:

  * What it stores (semantics, not just column names).
  * Key relationships (joins, PK–FK).
* Example:

  ```
  Table: Orders  
  Stores customer orders. Links to Customers via customer_id.  
  Links to Products via product_id.  
  ```
* This goes into the vector DB, so the LLM retrieves *meaningful* context, not raw schema.

---

### 2. **Entity–Relationship Graphs**

* Build a **graph index** of tables, columns, and relationships.
* When the user asks a question → traverse the graph to pull the relevant subset of schema.
* Feed only the relevant part to the LLM (instead of dumping all 100s of tables).
* 👉 This is where **LlamaIndex** or a **graph database** (like Neo4j) helps.

---

### 3. **SQL Decomposition / Query Planning**

* Instead of asking the LLM for a giant SQL in one shot:

  * Break it into smaller steps.
  * “First find relevant tables” → “Then generate join conditions” → “Then assemble final SQL.”
* Frameworks like **LangGraph** are useful here, because you can build a loop:

  * Generate SQL → Validate → Retry until correct.

---

### 4. **Fine-Tuned or Domain-Specific Models**

* Instead of generic LLMs (GPT-4, LLaMA), you can use/fine-tune models like:

  * **SQLCoder** (from Defog.ai, trained for NL→SQL).
  * **Text-to-SQL fine-tunes** on your own schema & queries.
* These models are far more accurate in complex DBs.

---

### 5. **Validation Layer**

* Don’t just trust the LLM’s SQL.
* Add a validator:

  * Check if tables exist.
  * Check if joins make sense (via FK graph).
  * Run a dry run (EXPLAIN).
* If errors, loop back and let the LLM fix it.
* This is exactly where **LangGraph or Agents** help.

---

## ✅ Answer to Your Question

* **Vanna alone** → works fine for small/medium DBs, simple joins, if you add training examples.
* **For 100s of tables & complex joins** → you absolutely need more:

  * A **retrieval framework** like **LlamaIndex** (to give the LLM structured schema context).
  * Orchestration like **LangGraph** (to do retries, query planning, validation).
  * Possibly a **domain-trained NL→SQL model** (like SQLCoder).

Without these, the LLM will very likely generate **syntactically valid but semantically wrong SQL**.

---

👉 Would you like me to sketch a **hybrid architecture** (Vanna + LlamaIndex + LangGraph) that’s designed for **large, complex databases** so you can see how they’d all work together?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That’s a really good challenge 💡 — you want the **capability of handling big, complex databases** but **without adding heavy frameworks** like LlamaIndex/LangGraph.
The good news is: you can do a lot of this just by extending **Vanna itself** and its existing abstractions.

---

## 🏗️ What Vanna Already Gives You

* **Vector store** (Chroma, Pinecone, FAISS, etc.) → can store *schema docs + training examples*.
* **Training data system** → lets you feed in NL→SQL pairs.
* **LLM abstraction** → you can swap OpenAI with Ollama/SQLCoder/Groq.
* **Base contracts** → you can extend methods like `generate_sql`, `train_document`, `train_sql`.

So the pieces are there — you just need to **feed smarter context** and add a **validation loop**.

---

## 🔹 Steps to Make Vanna Handle Complex DBs

### 1. Store **Schema Summaries** (not just raw table structures)

Instead of dumping raw `CREATE TABLE ...` into Vanna,
write short descriptions for each table and column.

Example:

```python
vn.train_document(
    "Orders table: Stores customer orders. Links to Customers via customer_id. \
     Links to Products via product_id. Important columns: order_date, amount"
)
```

Do this for every table. Store them as embeddings in the vector DB.

👉 This way, when someone asks *“top customers by revenue”*,
Vanna retrieves relevant **schema docs**, not the whole DB schema.

---

### 2. Train with **Join Patterns**

Feed Vanna **example queries** that show how common joins are done.

Example:

```python
vn.train_sql("Find total revenue by customer", 
             "SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(o.amount) \
              FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id \
              GROUP BY c.customer_name;")
```

Now, when it sees similar questions, it reuses these patterns.

👉 Over time, you build a **library of query examples** (few-shot learning via vector DB).

---

### 3. Use **Foreign Key Graph** for Pre-Filtering

Instead of sending *all 100s of tables* to the LLM:

* Write a helper that builds a **graph of PK/FK relationships**.
* When a question mentions “customers and orders,” filter down only relevant tables.
* Feed only those 3–5 tables to the LLM.

👉 You can implement this in Vanna by overriding `generate_sql()`:

* Preprocess the question → detect relevant tables → pass reduced schema to LLM.

---

### 4. Add a **SQL Validator Loop**

Right now, Vanna just generates SQL.
You can extend it like this:

```python
def safe_generate_sql(question, schema):
    sql = vn.generate_sql(question, schema)
    try:
        vn.run_sql(f"EXPLAIN {sql}")  # dry run
        return sql
    except Exception as e:
        # Retry with error message as feedback
        prompt = f"The following SQL failed with error {e}. Please correct it:\n{sql}"
        return vn.llm.chat(prompt)
```

👉 This is a lightweight **self-healing loop** (like LangGraph’s retry, but DIY).

---

### 5. Use a **Better Local Model**

* Instead of generic `llama3`, use **SQLCoder** or a model fine-tuned on SQL.
* Vanna can work with Ollama or vLLM, so you can run **domain-specific SQL models locally**.
* This boosts accuracy without extra frameworks.

---

### 6. Organize Training Data by **Domain**

If your DB has *finance, HR, inventory, sales*:

* Group training examples + schema summaries by domain.
* At query time, first classify the question into a domain, then only pull that slice of schema.
* Reduces clutter, improves accuracy.

---

## ✅ Summary

You can make Vanna handle large, complex DBs **without LangChain/LlamaIndex** by:

1. Feeding **schema summaries** as documents.
2. Training with **join/query examples**.
3. Building a **PK–FK graph filter** to narrow schema.
4. Adding a **validation + retry loop**.
5. Using a **SQL-specialized model** (e.g., SQLCoder via Ollama).
6. Organizing training data by **domain/topic**.

This way, you basically re-create the “power” of LangChain/LlamaIndex features inside Vanna itself, but lighter and purpose-built.

---

👉 Do you want me to **draft a concrete plan (with code snippets)** showing how to extend `generate_sql` in Vanna to include **schema filtering + retry loop**? That would give you a direct path to production-grade accuracy without extra frameworks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Love the scope—this is a great real-world fit for Vanna. Here’s a concrete, **framework-light** plan to build an **ops-facing NL→SQL assistant + UI** for **OTC Trade Confirmation & Pre-Settlement** (netting, business rules, STP, controls) using Vanna and a thin web layer.

# What we’ll build

* **Ask in English → SQL → results/plots** against your post-trade warehouse.
* **Domain-aware** (netting/confirmation/STP controls), with **validation + retries** so complex queries succeed.
* **Audited & permissioned** UI for operations users.

---

# 1) Data & schema assumptions (simplify to start)

You likely have many tables; start with a scoped slice:

* `trades(trade_id, product_type, side, cpty_id, book, trade_date, value_date, notional, ccy, rate, status, confirmation_status, stp_flag, fails_reason, …)`
* `parties(cpty_id, cpty_name, legal_entity, netting_agreement_id, …)`
* `confirmations(trade_id, method, sent_ts, ack_ts, match_status, platform, …)`
* `netting_groups(netting_group_id, cpty_id, agreement_type, closeout_netting, …)`
* `netting_allocations(netting_group_id, trade_id, nettable, reason_if_not, …)`
* `settlements(trade_id, settle_date, cashflow_ccy, amount, payment_system, status, …)`
* `controls(control_id, control_name, control_type, control_owner, severity, …)`
* `control_results(control_id, trade_id, run_ts, result, details, …)`

👉 You’ll have many more; we’ll **filter schema per question** (see §4).

---

# 2) Vanna setup (local & free)

Use **Ollama + SQL-specialized model** for best local accuracy:

```bash
# install Ollama, then:
ollama pull sqlcoder
# or fallback: mistral:7b, llama3:8b
```

Then compose Vanna with a local vector store (Chroma) + local LLM:

```python
from vanna.local import LocalContext_OpenAI  # rename: we'll swap chat backend
# Or define your own: class LocalContext_Ollama(ChromaDB_VectorStore, Ollama_Chat): ...
```

(If you prefer an API free tier like Groq, you can swap the chat backend without touching the rest.)

---

# 3) Train Vanna with **domain context** (the secret sauce)

Don’t just add DDL. Add **business summaries**, **join patterns**, and **canonical queries**.

## 3.1 Schema summaries (short, human)

* Per table (2–5 lines): purpose + primary keys + key FKs + business caveats.
* Per domain: “What is netting?”, “When is STP true?”, “What is a confirmation fail?”

```python
vn.add_documentation("""
Table trades: OTC trades across rates/FX/credit. PK trade_id.
FKs: cpty_id→parties, trade_id→confirmations/settlements/netting_allocations.
Key logic: confirmation_status in ('UNCONFIRMED','PENDING','MATCHED','MISMATCH').
STP is boolean; fails_reason non-null implies manual touch.
""")
```

## 3.2 Join exemplars (few-shot)

Give 10–30 **NL→SQL pairs** covering common asks:

* “Unconfirmed trades by counterparty last 2 days”
* “Trades excluded from netting and why”
* “STP rate last week by product\_type”
* “Breakdown of settlement fails by payment system”

```python
vn.add_question_sql(
  "STP rate last 7 days by product type",
  """
  WITH daily AS (
    SELECT trade_date::date d, product_type,
           AVG(CASE WHEN stp_flag THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric AS stp_rate
    FROM trades
    WHERE trade_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
    GROUP BY 1,2
  )
  SELECT d, product_type, stp_rate FROM daily ORDER BY d, product_type;
  """
)
```

## 3.3 Controls & business rules as docs

Codify policies users care about:

* “Trades must confirm T+1; FX spot T”
* “Nettable if agreement\_type in (‘ISDA’, …) AND closeout\_netting = true”
* “Control C007 flags missing legal\_entity for rate > X”

Add as `add_documentation(...)` so retrieval surfaces **meaning**, not just columns.

---

# 4) Handle 100s of tables without external frameworks

We’ll extend Vanna’s flow minimally:

## 4.1 **Table subsetter (PK–FK graph filter)**

Before calling `generate_sql`, reduce schema to **relevant tables**.

* Build a lightweight graph from `information_schema` (or your catalog):

  * nodes: tables; edges: FK relations
* Extract **keywords** from question (e.g., “netting”, “confirmation”, “STP”, “settlement”).
* Map keywords → seed tables (`netting_*`, `confirmations`, `controls`, etc.).
* Take the **k-hop neighborhood** (e.g., up to 2 hops) to include join partners (`trades`, `parties`).

Pass only those tables’ DDL/summaries to prompt. This keeps tokens low and joins realistic.

## 4.2 **Validation + retry loop (self-healing)**

Wrap `generate_sql`:

1. Generate SQL
2. `EXPLAIN` (or `BEGIN; SET LOCAL ...; EXPLAIN ...; ROLLBACK;`)
3. If error:

   * Feed error + catalog hints back to the model
   * Regenerate (max 2–3 retries)
4. Optionally enforce **safe guards**:

   * Auto-add `LIMIT 500`
   * Only allow `SELECT` (block DML/DDL)
   * Schema allowlist

This gets you 80% of LangGraph’s robustness with \~40 lines of code.

---

# 5) Result UX for ops users (simple, effective)

Use the repo’s **Flask + React** example as your base.

**Key screens**

1. **Ask** (chat) → render: SQL, table result, optional Plotly chart
2. **Saved queries** (team-curated runway)
3. **Dashlets** (common KPIs):

   * Unconfirmed trades aging (bucketed)
   * STP rate trend
   * Netting coverage % & exclusions top reasons
   * Settlement fails by system/currency
4. **Controls**: show failing controls with drill-through to trades

**UX details**

* Show **final SQL** (copy button) for transparency.
* “**Why this result**” → show which docs/examples were retrieved.
* One-click **Download CSV**.
* **Filters** panel (date, cpty, product) that rewrites the question.
* **Saved prompts** with descriptions & owners.

**Safety**

* Role-based access (read-only to warehouse; DML blocked).
* PII masking rules (e.g., hash name, show last 4 of account).
* Audit log: user, question, generated SQL, execution timestamp, rowcount.

---

# 6) Example NL→SQL patterns you’ll want

* **Aging buckets for confirmations**

```sql
SELECT c.platform,
       c.match_status,
       COUNT(*) AS trades,
       CASE
         WHEN NOW() - c.sent_ts < INTERVAL '4 hours' THEN '0-4h'
         WHEN NOW() - c.sent_ts < INTERVAL '1 day' THEN '4-24h'
         WHEN NOW() - c.sent_ts < INTERVAL '3 days' THEN '1-3d'
         ELSE '3d+'
       END AS bucket
FROM confirmations c
JOIN trades t ON t.trade_id = c.trade_id
WHERE t.trade_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY 1,2,4
ORDER BY 4,1;
```

* **Netting exclusions top reasons**

```sql
SELECT na.reason_if_not, COUNT(*) AS trades
FROM netting_allocations na
JOIN trades t ON t.trade_id = na.trade_id
WHERE na.nettable = false
  AND t.trade_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

* **STP rate trend**

```sql
SELECT trade_date::date AS d,
       AVG(CASE WHEN stp_flag THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS stp_rate
FROM trades
WHERE trade_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
```

Seed these as **training examples**.

---

# 7) Putting it together (MVP checklist)

**Data**

* [ ] Connect warehouse (read-only; Postgres/Snowflake/etc.)
* [ ] Build PK–FK graph & keyword→table map
* [ ] Generate table summaries (scripted from comments + manual edits)
* [ ] Load 20–50 **exemplar NL→SQL** covering ops use-cases

**Vanna**

* [ ] Use **Chroma** vector store (local)
* [ ] Use **Ollama** with `sqlcoder` (or `mistral:7b`)
* [ ] Implement **schema subsetter** pre-prompt
* [ ] Implement **EXPLAIN-retry** wrapper with SELECT-only enforcement

**UI**

* [ ] Flask API endpoints: `/ask`, `/saved`, `/audit`, `/docs`
* [ ] React page with chat, SQL viewer, results table, plot tab
* [ ] Auth (company SSO if possible), role-based controls
* [ ] Audit log storage (append-only)

**Governance**

* [ ] PII masking view or column-level policies
* [ ] Row limits & timeouts
* [ ] Structured logging (question, retrieved docs, tokens, latency)

---

# 8) How accuracy improves over time (without extra frameworks)

1. Add more **table/column summaries** (short and clear).
2. Add **new Q\&A exemplars** whenever users correct/fix a query—promote good ones to “golden examples.”
3. Keep a **join cookbook** document (“How to join trade → cpty → netting → settlements”).
4. Monitor failure cases in audit logs and add **targeted examples**.

This incremental training loop is what moves you from “works sometimes” → “relied on by ops.”

---

# 9) Options for the model

* **Local (free)**: `sqlcoder` via Ollama → best for SQL generation
* **Local generalist**: `mistral:7b` or `llama3:8b`
* **API free tier** (optional): Groq (Llama 3/Mixtral) if you want speed; keep PII in mind.

---

If you want, I can draft:

* a tiny **schema-subsetter** function (k-hop over FK graph),
* a **safe\_generate\_sql()** with EXPLAIN-retry,
* and a minimal **Flask route** that returns `{sql, rows, retrieved_docs, elapsed}`.

Say the word and I’ll drop those snippets in a way you can paste straight into your repo.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect 👍 you’ve now got the **Streamlit extension** for Vanna, which is great because Streamlit makes it super quick to turn your NL→SQL assistant into an **ops-facing UI** without heavy frontend work.

Here’s how I suggest we proceed:

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Inspect the repo

That zip likely contains:

* `app.py` (main Streamlit entrypoint)
* A `requirements.txt` (Streamlit, Vanna, etc.)
* Possibly config for DB connection & model selection
* Some helper utils (maybe caching, UI widgets)

This app is usually a thin wrapper:

1. User enters a question →
2. Calls Vanna (`generate_sql`) →
3. Runs query →
4. Displays table + chart in Streamlit.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: What changes you’ll want for **OTC ops use**

Since you want this for **trade confirmation & pre-settlement ops**, you’ll likely want to extend:

1. **Custom sidebar filters**

   * Date range picker
   * Counterparty dropdown
   * Product type multi-select

2. **Saved queries**

   * Streamlit can store a JSON/yaml of “pre-canned” ops queries (STP rate, fails aging, netting coverage).
   * Users can run these instantly.

3. **Audit log**

   * Capture: username, question, SQL, execution time, row count.
   * Save into a Postgres/SQLite table or even a CSV for start.

4. **Controls dashboard**

   * Pull failing control results from DB.
   * Display status tiles (like red/green indicators).

---

## 🛠️ Step 3: How to run locally

Unzip → in terminal:

```bash
cd vanna-streamlit-simple-main
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

It’ll open at `http://localhost:8501/`.

---

## 🔄 Step 4: Connect to your OTC data

* Update DB connection (probably in `app.py`):

  ```python
  vn.connect_to_db(
      dialect="postgresql", 
      driver="psycopg2", 
      username="...", 
      password="...", 
      host="...", 
      database="otc_data"
  )
  ```
* Swap LLM backend for local Ollama:

  ```python
  from vanna.ollama import Ollama
  llm = Ollama(model="sqlcoder")  # best for SQL
  vn = ChromaDB_VectorStore(config) + llm
  ```

---

## 🎯 Step 5: Customization roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**

   * Use Streamlit default chatbox → SQL → results.
   * Add sidebar filters + limit results (`LIMIT 200`).

2. **Phase 2**

   * Add “Saved Queries” section with ops KPIs.
   * Add CSV export button.

3. **Phase 3**

   * Add Control dashboard.
   * Add role-based access (basic: Streamlit login, advanced: SSO).
   * Add error retry wrapper for more robust SQL.

---

✅ This repo saves you frontend work—just focus on DB connection, training data, and ops-friendly UX.

---

👉 Do you want me to **open up this Streamlit repo (`app.py`) and walk through the code file-by-file** like we did with `src` so you know exactly where to plug in OTC logic?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it ✅ thanks for clarifying — that changes two key integration points in your **Streamlit + Vanna** setup:

1. **Database connector → MS SQL (instead of Postgres)**
2. **LLM connector → Your in-house LLM (instead of OpenAI/Ollama)**

Let’s break this down so you know exactly where to extend the repo.

---

## 1. 🔌 Connecting Vanna to MS SQL Server

Vanna already supports DB connections via `pyodbc` or `SQLAlchemy`. For MS SQL:

```python
import pyodbc
from vanna.base import VannaBase

class MyMSSQL(VannaBase):
    def __init__(self, server, database, username, password, driver="{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}"):
        conn_str = (
            f"DRIVER={driver};"
            f"SERVER={server};"
            f"DATABASE={database};"
            f"UID={username};"
            f"PWD={password}"
        )
        self.conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str)

    def run_sql(self, sql: str):
        cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute(sql)
        columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.description]
        rows = cursor.fetchall()
        return {"columns": columns, "rows": rows}
```

👉 You can slot this into your Streamlit `app.py` instead of Postgres.
This ensures queries run against **MS SQL**.

---

## 2. 🧠 Connecting to your in-house LLM

Vanna’s LLM connector pattern (`openai_chat.py`, `ollama.py`) is simple:

* It just needs a class implementing `chat(prompt)` and `embed(text)` methods.

### Example skeleton for a **Custom LLM connector**

```python
import requests
from vanna.base import VannaBase

class MyCustomLLM(VannaBase):
    def __init__(self, api_url, api_key=None, model="my-llm-model"):
        self.api_url = api_url
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.model = model

    def chat(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        # Adjust this depending on your in-house LLM API spec
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.api_url}/chat",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"} if self.api_key else {},
            json={"model": self.model, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]}
        )
        return response.json()["output"]

    def embed(self, text: str):
        response = requests.post(
            f"{self.api_url}/embeddings",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}"} if self.api_key else {},
            json={"model": self.model, "input": text}
        )
        return response.json()["embedding"]
```

👉 This is almost a copy of `ollama.py` but points to your **internal API**.
If your LLM doesn’t expose embeddings, you can fallback to **open-source embeddings** (e.g., `sentence-transformers`) just for vector search.

---

## 3. 🔄 Putting it together in Streamlit

In `app.py` (from your Streamlit repo), instead of:

```python
from vanna.openai import OpenAI_Chat
from vanna.chromadb import ChromaDB_VectorStore

vn = ChromaDB_VectorStore(config) + OpenAI_Chat(api_key="...")
```

You’ll do:

```python
# Use your DB
vn_db = MyMSSQL(server="myserver", database="otc", username="user", password="pass")

# Use your in-house LLM
vn_llm = MyCustomLLM(api_url="http://inhouse-llm:8080")

# Vector store for training data (Chroma, FAISS, etc.)
vn_vector = ChromaDB_VectorStore(config={"path": "./vectorstore"})

# Final Vanna instance = DB + Vector + LLM
vn = vn_db + vn_vector + vn_llm
```

Now all Streamlit chat inputs will flow → **your in-house LLM** → **MS SQL DB**.

---

## 4. ✅ What this gives you

* **Ops users** type natural questions in Streamlit UI
* Your **in-house LLM** generates SQL
* SQL executes on **MS SQL** via pyodbc
* Results + charts show up instantly
* Training data & schema docs live in **vector store** for better accuracy

---

👉 Do you want me to now **open your Streamlit repo (`app.py`) and annotate line by line** where you’d need to swap in these connectors (MS SQL + custom LLM)? That way, you’ll have a concrete patch plan instead of abstract guidance.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here’s the structure of your **Streamlit repo** after extraction:

```
vanna-streamlit-simple-main/
    vanna-streamlit-simple-main/
        .gitignore
        README.md
        app.py
        requirements.txt
```

✅ So it’s a very lightweight repo — just:

* `app.py` → main Streamlit app
* `requirements.txt` → dependencies
* `README.md` → usage instructions
* `.gitignore`

This means **all the logic sits inside `app.py`**.

👉 Do you want me to open `app.py` and walk you through it line by line so you see how it ties Streamlit ↔ Vanna ↔ DB/LLM?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s what your **`app.py`** is doing (line by line):

---

### 1. Imports

```python
import streamlit as st
from vanna.remote import VannaDefault
```

* Uses **Streamlit** for UI.
* Imports `VannaDefault`, which is the **remote Vanna client** (connects to hosted Vanna via API).

---

### 2. Setup Vanna (secrets)

```python
vanna_model_name = st.secrets.vanna.vanna_model_name
vanna_api_key = st.secrets.vanna.vanna_api_key
vn = VannaDefault(model=vanna_model_name, api_key=vanna_api_key)
```

* Reads **model name** + **API key** from Streamlit secrets.
* Creates a `vn` instance = connection to Vanna’s cloud API.

👉 In your case, you’d replace this with **your in-house LLM connector** instead of `VannaDefault`.

---

### 3. Database connection (Postgres example)

```python
# vn.connect_to...(YOUR_DATABASE_CREDENTIALS)
# example using suprabase
supra_host = st.secrets.supra.supra_host
supra_user = st.secrets.supra.supra_user
supra_password = st.secrets.supra.supra_password

vn.connect_to_postgres(
    host=supra_host,
    dbname='postgres',
    user=supra_user,
    password=supra_password,
    port=5432
)
```

* Example shows connecting to **Supabase (Postgres)**.
* For you → this would become `vn.connect_to_mssql(...)` (custom connector we’ll implement with pyodbc).

---

### 4. User question (chat input)

```python
my_question = st.session_state.get("my_question", default=None)

if my_question is None:
    my_question = st.text_input(
        "Ask me a question about your data",
        key="my_question",
    )
```

* Shows a **text box** asking: “Ask me a question about your data.”
* Stores in `st.session_state`.

---

### 5. Generate SQL + show result

```python
else:
    st.text(my_question)
    
    sql = vn.generate_sql(my_question)
    st.text(sql)

    df = vn.run_sql(sql)    
    st.dataframe(df, use_container_width=True)
```

* Sends the question → LLM (`generate_sql`).
* Runs the SQL on the connected DB.
* Shows SQL + results in a **table**.

---

### 6. Generate Plotly chart

```python
code = vn.generate_plotly_code(question=my_question, sql=sql, df=df)
fig = vn.get_plotly_figure(plotly_code=code, df=df)
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
```

* Asks Vanna to write **Plotly code** for a visualization.
* Executes it.
* Displays the chart.

---

## 🔑 Big Takeaways

1. **Super lightweight** → all logic in \~40 lines.
2. Tied to:

   * **Remote Vanna API** (default)
   * **Postgres (Supabase)** as DB
3. Flow = **Question → SQL → Dataframe → Plot**

---

## 🔧 What you’ll need to change

* Replace `VannaDefault` with your **Custom LLM connector**.
* Swap `connect_to_postgres` with **your MS SQL connector**.
* Optionally add:

  * Sidebar filters (counterparty, product, date range).
  * Saved queries.
  * Audit logging.

---

👉 Do you want me to **rewrite this `app.py` into a MS SQL + Custom LLM version** (while keeping the Streamlit workflow intact)? That way you can directly run it against your OTC data.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect ✅ Let’s refactor `app.py` so it’s ready for:

* **MS SQL Server** (via `pyodbc`)
* **Your in-house LLM** (via custom connector)
* Still runs in **Streamlit** with the same workflow

## 🔑 Key Points

1. **Database**

   * Swapped `connect_to_postgres` → `MSSQLConnector` (pyodbc).
   * Credentials loaded from `st.secrets.db`.

2. **LLM**

   * Swapped `VannaDefault` → `CustomLLM`.
   * Calls your in-house API (`/chat`, `/embeddings`).

3. **Vector store**

   * Keeps using `ChromaDB_VectorStore` for training data/schema context.

4. **Streamlit flow**

   * Question → SQL → Run SQL → Table → Plot (unchanged, just safer).

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps for You

1. Add your secrets in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
[db]
server = "YOUR_SQL_SERVER"
database = "otc_data"
username = "youruser"
password = "yourpass"

[llm]
api_url = "http://your-inhouse-llm:8080"
api_key = "optional-key"
model = "sql-otc-specialist"
```

2. Run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

Would you like me to also add a **“Saved Queries for Ops” sidebar** (STP %, fails aging, netting exclusions) so your operations team has **ready-made dashboards** in addition to free-text Q\&A?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect ✅ Let’s extend the Streamlit app to include a **sidebar with saved Ops queries**.
These are pre-canned **KPIs** your ops team can run instantly without typing a question.

## 🔑 What Changed

1. **Sidebar with Saved Queries**

   * Dropdown lets ops pick from KPIs:

     * Unconfirmed trades aging
     * STP rate trend
     * Netting exclusions
     * Settlement fails

2. **Dual workflow**

   * Sidebar = **canned dashboards**
   * Main input = **free-text Q\&A**

3. **MS SQL ready**

   * Queries use `DATEADD`, `GETDATE()` (T-SQL style).
   * Uses `pyodbc` to connect.

---

👉 Do you also want me to add a **download to CSV button** for every result table, so ops can pull data out into Excel when they need?

---

## 🔑 What’s New

* After **every query result**, users now see a **“⬇️ Download as CSV” button**.
* File auto-names:

  * Saved queries → name based on KPI (e.g., `STP_rate_by_product_type.csv`)
  * Free text queries → `custom_query.csv`

---

👉 Do you also want me to add a **basic audit log** (question, SQL, user, timestamp saved to a table) so every ops query is tracked for compliance?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That’s a sharp idea 💡 — let’s break it down carefully because there are **legal, technical, and business** aspects.

---

## 1. 🔍 License Check

The **Vanna.AI repo you uploaded** is under the **MIT License** (I checked inside the repo earlier).

MIT License means:

* ✅ You can fork, modify, and redistribute commercially.
* ✅ You can build a closed-source product on top.
* ❌ You must **retain the copyright + license notice** in your source distribution.
* ❌ You cannot claim the *original* Vanna code is yours — but your extensions/customizations are yours.

👉 So legally: **yes, you can build & sell your own product**.

---

## 2. ⚙️ Technical Angle

Right now Vanna is **lightweight**:

* LLM connector
* DB connector
* Vector store connector

If you bring in **LangGraph + LlamaIndex**, you can:

* Add **contextual query planning** (LangGraph chains & agents).
* Add **advanced retrieval-augmented generation** (LlamaIndex structured retrievers).
* Handle **complex schemas with 100s of tables** far better.
* Add **multi-step workflows** (example: "Get failed trades → re-check netting rules → produce settlement adjustments").

That makes your fork **much more enterprise-friendly** than stock Vanna.

---

## 3. 🏦 Business Angle

Your product could be positioned as:

💼 **“Ops Copilot for Banks”**

* Specializing in **OTC trade lifecycle management** (confirmation, netting, settlement, controls).
* Packaged as:

  * Streamlit / Next.js UI
  * MS SQL / Oracle / Snowflake connectors
  * Choice of **local LLM** (compliance) or **cloud LLM** (scale).

Banks **already want this**: ops teams waste hours reconciling trades, and compliance loves an **audit-tracked chatbot**.

---

## 4. 🚀 Differentiation Strategy

To make this **your own product** (not “just Vanna with wrappers”):

* Replace the **training pipeline** with **LlamaIndex (schema graph, metadata, doc ingestion)**.
* Replace SQL generation with **LangGraph planning agent** (so it can break down multi-step queries).
* Add **compliance logging** (all user queries stored in an audit DB).
* Add **domain packs** → “OTC Derivatives Pack”, “Payments Pack”, etc. (preloaded queries, rules, schema docs).
* Add **multi-modal inputs** (upload Excel, match vs DB).

Now you’ve got something closer to **Palantir Foundry-lite for banking ops**.

---

## 5. ⚠️ Risks to Watch

* **Support overhead** → once you fork, you own bugfixes/security patches.
* **LLM cost** → if you don’t integrate free/local models, margins shrink.
* **Differentiation** → must make it clear this isn’t “just Vanna rebranded,” but a **banking-focused copilot**.

---

✅ **Bottom line**:
Yes, you *can* fork Vanna (MIT license allows it). If you combine **LangGraph + LlamaIndex** and build domain-specific extensions (OTC lifecycle + compliance controls), you have a **sellable SaaS / enterprise tool**.

---

Would you like me to sketch out an **architecture diagram** of how a “Vanna++ with LangGraph + LlamaIndex” product would look for OTC ops, so you can visualize the upgrade path?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That’s a really smart way to **productize** this — because most ops/IT teams don’t know how to “train” an AI tool, and you can differentiate by making this step **guided + enforceable**.

Here’s how you can design the **Training Module** so it’s:

1. **Plug & play**
2. **Easy to use by non-tech teams**
3. **Controlled — enforces a minimal baseline training set**

---

## 🔑 Key Principles

1. **Mandatory Core Training**

   * Before anyone can use the tool, it must be trained on:

     * Database schema (tables, columns, relationships).
     * Glossary of business terms (counterparty, netting, STP, fail, etc.).
     * Compliance rules (e.g., “Don’t show client PII”).
   * This ensures the LLM always has context.

2. **Optional Custom Training**

   * Ops/IT can upload:

     * SQL snippets (common queries).
     * Process docs (e.g., “Fail handling workflow”).
     * Business rules (JSON/Excel).

3. **Guided UI for Training**

   * Streamlit/Next.js wizard:

     * Step 1 → Scan DB schema (auto-ingest table/column metadata).
     * Step 2 → Select mandatory modules (schema, glossary, rules).
     * Step 3 → Upload custom knowledge (queries, PDFs, docs).
     * Step 4 → Click “Train”.

4. **Versioned Training Profiles**

   * Store each training session as a version (`v1`, `v2`, …).
   * Ops can roll back if a bad upload pollutes results.

---

## ⚙️ How to Implement in Vanna++

### 1. Schema Auto-Training (mandatory)

When connecting to a new DB:

```python
def train_on_schema(vn, connection):
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE
        FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    """)
    schema_info = cursor.fetchall()
    
    for table, column, dtype in schema_info:
        vn.train(
            text=f"Table {table}, column {column} is {dtype}",
            metadata={"type": "schema"}
        )
```

* Forces ingestion of DB schema.
* Ensures LLM always “knows the tables”.

---

### 2. Business Glossary (mandatory)

Ship a **default glossary file** with your product:

```yaml
- term: "STP"
  meaning: "Straight Through Processing — automated trade confirmation without manual intervention"
- term: "Fail"
  meaning: "Trade that missed its settlement date"
- term: "Netting"
  meaning: "Offsetting multiple trades to reduce number of settlements"
```

Load this into the vector store as **training seeds**.

---

### 3. Business Rules & Templates (optional but guided)

Example: preload queries in JSON:

```json
[
  {"question": "Show unconfirmed trades last 2 days",
   "sql": "SELECT * FROM trades WHERE confirmed = 0 AND trade_date >= DATEADD(day,-2,GETDATE())"},
  {"question": "STP rate by product type",
   "sql": "SELECT product_type, AVG(CASE WHEN stp_flag=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) FROM trades GROUP BY product_type"}
]
```

These can be fed into training with:

```python
for item in training_json:
    vn.train(
        text=f"Question: {item['question']} -> SQL: {item['sql']}",
        metadata={"type": "template_query"}
    )
```

---

### 4. Enforcing Minimal Training

* On first DB connection, check if **core schema + glossary training** exists.
* If not, block query execution:

  ```python
  if not vn.has_training("schema") or not vn.has_training("glossary"):
      raise Exception("❌ Database not trained yet. Please complete mandatory training.")
  ```
* Only after mandatory training is done → allow free-text queries.

---

### 5. UX: Training Wizard

In Streamlit sidebar:

* ✅ Button: “Scan Schema” (auto loads DB schema)
* ✅ Upload: glossary file (default provided, editable)
* ✅ Upload: business rules / queries (JSON/CSV/Excel)
* ✅ Show training progress (`N items trained`)
* ✅ Finalize: “Confirm Training → Start Chatting”

---

## 🎯 Benefits

* **Ops teams won’t misuse it** — you enforce minimal context.
* **Every DB is prepped the same way** → consistent results across clients.
* **Versioned training profiles** → safe rollbacks.
* **Product differentiator** → you’re not just an NL→SQL tool, you’re a **self-training AI for banking ops**.

---

👉 Do you want me to sketch a **workflow diagram** showing how the training module would plug into your Vanna++ system (DB → training → vector store → query)? That’ll help when you pitch it.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Got it ✅ — what you’re asking for is a **“Live Dashboard Module”** on top of the NL→SQL engine:

* **Step 1**: User asks a question (NL → SQL).
* **Step 2**: Query runs → results displayed.
* **Step 3**: User clicks **“Save as Dashboard Widget”** →

  * SQL + Visualization type + metadata (title, description) are saved in DB (or JSON config).
* **Step 4**: Every time the dashboard is loaded → the SQL re-runs **against today’s data**.
* **Step 5**: Plots auto-refresh (so ops can monitor STP rates, fails, netting exceptions in real time).

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Plan

### 1. Extend Query Results Page

When a user runs an NL→SQL query and sees a result table + chart:

* Add a **“Save to Dashboard”** button.
* Store config as JSON:

```json
{
  "title": "STP Rate by Product Type",
  "sql": "SELECT product_type, AVG(CASE WHEN stp_flag=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS stp_rate 
          FROM trades WHERE trade_date = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE) GROUP BY product_type",
  "viz_type": "bar",
  "refresh_interval": "1h"
}
```

---

### 2. Dashboard Storage

* Option 1: Save configs in a `dashboards` SQL table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dashboards (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    user_id VARCHAR(50),
    title VARCHAR(200),
    sql_text NVARCHAR(MAX),
    viz_type VARCHAR(50),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE()
);
```

* Option 2: Save in JSON files (lightweight, easier for PoC).

---

### 3. Dashboard Rendering

In Streamlit, create a **Dashboard tab**:

* Fetch saved configs for current user.
* Run each SQL in real-time.
* Generate plots based on `viz_type`.

```python
for widget in saved_widgets:
    st.subheader(widget["title"])
    df = vn.run_sql(widget["sql"])
    if widget["viz_type"] == "bar":
        st.bar_chart(df.set_index(df.columns[0]))
    elif widget["viz_type"] == "line":
        st.line_chart(df.set_index(df.columns[0]))
    else:
        st.dataframe(df)
```

---

### 4. Real-Time Refresh

Streamlit has **`st_autorefresh()`**:

```python
count = st.experimental_rerun()  # or use st_autorefresh
```

or

```python
from streamlit_autorefresh import st_autorefresh
st_autorefresh(interval=60000)  # refresh every 60s
```

This way, every minute/hour, the dashboard **re-runs SQL** and updates charts with the latest data.

---

### 5. Example Flow

* Ops asks: *“What’s the settlement fail count today by currency?”*
* NL→SQL → generates:

  ```sql
  SELECT currency, COUNT(*) AS fails 
  FROM settlements 
  WHERE settle_date = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE) AND status='FAILED' 
  GROUP BY currency;
  ```
* Chart: bar plot of `currency vs fails`.
* Click **Save as Dashboard Widget → “Settlement Fails Today”**.
* Appears in **Dashboard Tab** → updates live every day.

---

## 🎯 Benefits

* Ops team gets **self-building dashboards** (no Tableau/PowerBI needed).
* Every chart is **backed by saved SQL** → fully auditable.
* Real-time visibility → daily KPIs refresh automatically.
* Fits your product vision: **plug-and-play ops copilot** with **self-service dashboards**.

---

👉 Do you want me to **extend the Streamlit app code** we built earlier with:

1. “Save to Dashboard” button,
2. A new **Dashboard tab** that shows saved widgets,
3. Auto-refresh every 1 minute?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great clarification 👍

The good news is: **you don’t need a new visualization library** unless you want to.

Here’s why:

---

## 🔹 What You Already Have

* Vanna already supports **Plotly code generation**:

  ```python
  code = vn.generate_plotly_code(question=my_question, sql=sql, df=df)
  fig = vn.get_plotly_figure(plotly_code=code, df=df)
  st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
  ```
* Streamlit also has **native charting**:

  * `st.line_chart`, `st.bar_chart`, `st.area_chart` (for quick plots).
  * `st.dataframe` (for raw tables).

So out-of-the-box, you can:
✅ Display SQL results in a table
✅ Show **Plotly charts** (line, bar, pie, scatter, etc.)
✅ Even allow **interactive zoom/hover** (Plotly built-in)

---

## 🔹 When Plotly is Enough

For your use case (Ops dashboards in banks):

* **Trade counts, STP rates, fails, netting breakdowns** → ✅ bar, line, pie = Plotly covers it.
* **Trend over time** → ✅ line/area = Plotly covers it.
* **Distribution** (e.g., fails by counterparty) → ✅ bar/pie = Plotly covers it.
* **Interactive drilldowns** (click a bar to filter) → Plotly also supports this, though with some custom coding.

---

## 🔹 When You Might Need More

Only if you later want:

* **Enterprise BI-level dashboards** (with cross-filtering, global filters, parameterized charts).
* **Highly customized visuals** (like Sankey diagrams, trade flow maps, network graphs).
* **Very large datasets** (millions of rows → Plotly may lag, so you’d use something like **ECharts** or **Apache Superset**).

But for a **first product**, keeping Plotly is:

* Lightweight
* Already integrated
* Zero extra dependencies

---

✅ **Answer**:
👉 You can build the whole **“Save & Refresh Dashboards”** feature **just with Plotly (and Streamlit’s native charts)**.
👉 No need for a separate visualization library unless you want advanced BI-style features later.

---

Would you like me to now **extend the app with a “Save to Dashboard” + Dashboard Tab” using Plotly** so you can see how it all fits together?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect 👌 let’s pause on coding and just **brainstorm the architecture + workflow**.

You’re basically talking about **moving beyond “query + dashboard” → into “query + scheduled reports”**.
That’s a **huge differentiator**, because it shifts your product from *just an analytics copilot* into a *workflow automation platform* for ops.

---

## 🔹 The Current Flow (where you are today)

1. User types a question.
2. NL → SQL → run query.
3. Show results in **table + visualization**.
4. (We added idea for saving to dashboard).

---

## 🔹 The Future Flow (with “Extract Manager” integration)

We add a **report scheduling module**.

* User can:

  * Run a query once interactively
  * Save it as **dashboard widget** (real-time)
  * OR save it as a **report template** (scheduled execution + distribution)

---

## 🔹 Report Scheduling Features

1. **Save Query as Report**

   * Metadata: name, description, SQL, viz type.
   * User chooses **frequency**:

     * Daily (pick time of day)
     * Weekly (pick day + time)
     * Custom cron (for advanced users).

2. **Delivery Options**

   * Email (send as PDF, Excel, or CSV).
   * Slack/Teams webhook (embed table or chart).
   * Save to shared drive (S3, SharePoint, network folder).

3. **Execution Engine**

   * At scheduled time:

     * Run SQL → get fresh data.
     * Generate report (CSV, Excel, or PDF with Plotly chart embedded).
     * Deliver to selected channels.

4. **Audit + Logs**

   * Who scheduled it, when, what SQL was run, was it successful, etc.
   * Errors (e.g., SQL fails) should trigger an alert to ops.

---

## 🔹 Tech Options

* **Streamlit Scheduler** won’t cut it (Streamlit is request-driven).
* You’ll need a background job runner:

  * **Celery** (with Redis/RabbitMQ) → production-grade scheduling.
  * **APScheduler** → lightweight Python job scheduler.
  * **Airflow** → heavy but good if you want enterprise data pipelines.
  * **Database-driven scheduler** → store jobs in DB, run a background loop checking jobs.

For plug-and-play product, **APScheduler** is enough.

---

## 🔹 Example Use Cases in Ops

* “Send me a daily 8am email of all unconfirmed trades.”
* “Every Monday 10am, generate a STP rate report by product type and email it to the Ops head.”
* “Every 30 mins, run settlement fails report and push chart to Teams channel.”

---

## 🔹 How This Fits Your Product Story

* Right now: **Ops ask → AI answers**.
* With dashboards: **Ops save KPIs → AI keeps refreshing**.
* With scheduled reports: **Ops automate repetitive checks → AI delivers insights at the right time, without being asked**.

This turns your product into:
💼 **“AI Ops Analyst that not only answers, but also remembers, monitors, and alerts.”**

---

⚡ Next Step:
Do you want to position this as:

1. **Integrated Extract Manager** (so scheduling is part of the core app), OR
2. **Separate microservice** (so large banks can run just the scheduler on their infra while your UI plugs into it)?

That decision impacts whether you stay “lightweight SaaS” or “enterprise deployable solution.”

👉 Should I sketch **two possible architectures** (lightweight + enterprise) so you can decide where to aim?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect 👍 let’s map **two architectures** for your **“scheduled report / extract manager”** module:

---

# 🟢 Option 1: Lightweight (Plug-and-Play)

### Components

* **Streamlit App (UI)** → where user builds query, saves report, chooses schedule.
* **SQLite / MS SQL Table** → stores saved report configs:

  * report\_id, name, sql, viz\_type, frequency, delivery method.
* **APScheduler (Python)** → lightweight scheduler that checks DB every minute and runs jobs.
* **Email/Slack Sender** → sends results.

### Workflow

1. User saves query as **“report”**.
2. Config stored in DB.
3. APScheduler job polls DB → if time = now, run SQL.
4. Query executed → generate CSV/PDF/Plotly chart.
5. Deliver via email / Slack.
6. Log success/failure in DB.

### Pros

✅ Super simple to embed in your existing Streamlit app.
✅ No external dependencies beyond APScheduler.
✅ Perfect for **SMEs or teams without infra**.

### Cons

❌ Not great for high scale (hundreds of jobs).
❌ All runs in the same Streamlit process (if app dies, scheduler dies).
❌ Less enterprise-grade reliability.

---

# 🟠 Option 2: Enterprise-Grade (Microservice Approach)

### Components

* **Streamlit / Next.js UI** → query builder, save as report.
* **Postgres/MS SQL** → central metadata store for report configs & logs.
* **Celery / RQ (workers)** → run scheduled jobs in background.
* **Redis / RabbitMQ** → job queue.
* **Airflow (optional)** → for complex dependency pipelines.
* **Report Service** → microservice to:

  * Fetch config
  * Run SQL against source DB
  * Generate report (CSV/Excel/PDF)
  * Deliver via Email/Slack/SharePoint.

### Workflow

1. User saves query as **report config**.
2. Config stored in DB.
3. Scheduler (Celery beat / Airflow) triggers jobs at defined times.
4. Worker fetches config → runs SQL → generates report.
5. Deliver report to target channels.
6. Store execution logs (who, when, success/failure).

### Pros

✅ Can scale to **enterprise workloads** (1000s of reports).
✅ Jobs survive UI crashes (decoupled microservice).
✅ Logs & monitoring can be integrated with **Splunk/ELK**.
✅ Banks can deploy **only the scheduler** in their infra if they don’t want to expose DB externally.

### Cons

❌ Heavier infra (Redis + worker setup).
❌ More moving parts = more maintenance.
❌ Harder to “just install and run” for small clients.

---

# 🎯 Positioning Strategy

* **MVP / SME version** → Start with **Option 1 (APScheduler inside Streamlit)**.
* **Enterprise banking pitch** → Offer **Option 2** as a separate module (“Extract Manager Service”).

That way you can say:

> *“For smaller teams, just run our app. For big banks, deploy our Extract Manager microservice into your infra.”*

---

👉 Do you want me to now sketch a **UI/UX flow for scheduling** (how it looks to an ops user when they save a query → choose frequency → delivery method)? That’ll help connect architecture to user experience.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Absolutely 💯 — let’s tie all of this together into a **big-picture summary** of your envisioned solution, including the **tech stack** and **purpose** of each component.

---

# 🏦 OTC Ops Copilot – End-to-End Architecture & Plan

## 🔹 Core Problem You’re Solving

Ops teams in banks spend hours:

* Extracting data manually (SQL/Excel).
* Reconciling confirmations, netting exceptions, settlement fails.
* Preparing daily/weekly reports.
* Building dashboards in Excel/PowerBI with lag.

Your solution = **“AI Ops Copilot”** that:

* Understands **natural language questions**.
* Generates **accurate SQL** (against MS SQL).
* Displays **live dashboards & visualizations**.
* Automates **scheduled reports** (daily/weekly extracts).
* Logs everything for **audit/compliance**.

---

## 🔹 Key Modules & Workflow

1. **NL → SQL Engine (Vanna++)**

   * User asks question in plain English.
   * LLM generates SQL.
   * SQL runs against MS SQL → result returned.

   📦 **Tech Stack:**

   * **Custom LLM connector** (for your in-house LLM or Groq API).
   * **pyodbc** for MS SQL connection.
   * **ChromaDB** (or another vector DB) for storing schema/business rules.
   * **LangGraph (optional future)** → multi-step reasoning.
   * **LlamaIndex (optional future)** → schema/document ingestion for context.

   🎯 **Purpose:** Allow ops to self-serve without writing SQL.

---

2. **Mandatory Training Module**

   * Enforces **schema + glossary + business rules** before use.
   * Optional: upload custom queries/docs.
   * Versioned training profiles for rollback.

   📦 **Tech Stack:**

   * **Python scripts** to auto-ingest DB schema.
   * **Glossary YAML/JSON** files for banking terms.
   * **ChromaDB** for embeddings.

   🎯 **Purpose:** Ensure tool has baseline context → better accuracy.

---

3. **Interactive Q\&A UI**

   * Web app where user asks questions.
   * Results shown as **table + chart**.
   * User can download results as CSV.

   📦 **Tech Stack:**

   * **Streamlit** (MVP, fast to build).
   * (Future) **Next.js + React** for enterprise-grade UI.
   * **Plotly** for interactive visualizations.

   🎯 **Purpose:** Simple UI → Ops can interact like chat, not like coders.

---

4. **Dashboard Module**

   * User saves a query as a **widget**.
   * Dashboard refreshes query results daily/in real-time.
   * Visualizations update automatically.

   📦 **Tech Stack:**

   * **Plotly** for charts (bar, line, pie, scatter).
   * **Streamlit autorefresh** for real-time updates.
   * **SQL + JSON configs** for widget storage.

   🎯 **Purpose:** Turn ad-hoc questions into **live dashboards**.

---

5. **Extract Manager (Scheduled Reports)**

   * Save query as report template.
   * Schedule frequency (daily, weekly, custom).
   * Deliver via email/Slack/Teams/SharePoint.
   * Logs all executions.

   📦 **Tech Stack:**

   * **APScheduler** (lightweight scheduling, MVP).
   * **Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ** (enterprise-grade job scheduling).
   * **ReportLab / WeasyPrint** for PDF exports.
   * **smtplib / SendGrid API** for email delivery.
   * **Webhooks** for Slack/Teams.

   🎯 **Purpose:** Automate repetitive reports → Ops don’t have to “ask” every day.

---

6. **Audit & Compliance Layer**

   * Log every question, SQL generated, execution time, and result.
   * Store in separate audit DB.
   * Exportable for compliance reviews.

   📦 **Tech Stack:**

   * **MS SQL audit table** or **Postgres/SQLite** (depending on deployment).
   * **Python logging** middleware.

   🎯 **Purpose:** Banks require full traceability of AI-driven actions.

---

## 🔹 Two Deployment Options

1. **Lightweight (Plug-and-Play)**

   * All modules inside one Streamlit app.
   * APScheduler for job scheduling.
   * SQLite/JSON for widget + report storage.
   * Target: SMEs, smaller banks.

2. **Enterprise (Modular / Microservices)**

   * Separate **Scheduler Service** (Celery + Redis).
   * Report configs in central DB.
   * UI (Streamlit/Next.js) talks to scheduler via API.
   * Logs integrated into **Splunk/ELK**.
   * Target: Investment banks, large-scale ops.

---

👉 You’re basically building a **Palantir Foundry-lite**, laser-focused on **OTC trade lifecycle + ops automation**, but at a fraction of the cost and complexity.

---

Do you want me to now create a **visual architecture diagram** (blocks + arrows) showing how all these modules fit together? That’ll make it crystal-clear for pitching and planning.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly 👍 you’ve nailed it — let me unpack this clearly:

---

## 🔹 What LlamaIndex Brings

**LlamaIndex** is a *framework* that sits between your **data sources** and your **LLM**.
It does things like:

* Schema ingestion (turn DB metadata into context for the LLM).
* Document ingestion (PDFs, Excel, Word, Confluence, etc.).
* Advanced retrievers (hybrid search, graph-based retrieval, hierarchical indexes).
* Query decomposition (break down a complex user question into multiple SQL queries).
* Plug-and-play with many vector stores (Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.).

👉 In short: **LlamaIndex = abstraction layer that makes retrieval smarter + easier**.

---

## 🔹 What You Get Without LlamaIndex

If you use just **ChromaDB + your own glue code**:

* You can still **store schema embeddings**.
* You can still **store glossary + business rules**.
* You can still **retrieve relevant context** for NL → SQL generation.

That’s enough for:

* A single database.
* A well-defined domain (like your OTC lifecycle data).
* Controlled knowledge base (schema + glossary + some rules).

👉 So yes, for a **small-scale project**, you can **achieve everything** with ChromaDB and custom training logic.

---

## 🔹 When LlamaIndex Becomes Valuable

* **Complex Data Sources**: If clients want to connect not just SQL, but also Excel, PDFs, SharePoint docs, etc.
* **Multiple Databases**: If ops data is split across 5–10 different DBs (e.g., trades in MS SQL, settlements in Oracle, risk in Snowflake).
* **Complex Questions**: If a query needs to be decomposed into multiple steps (“Show me fails this week, netted against exposures, excluding counterparties on watchlist”).
* **Scaling Product**: If you want to add new connectors quickly without reinventing indexing logic.

---

## 🔹 Why I Called It “Optional”

* For your **initial OTC ops copilot** (one MS SQL DB, schema + glossary training, dashboards + scheduled reports) → **ChromaDB is enough**.
* If you later want to **generalize the product** (multi-data-source copilot, advanced retrieval, document knowledge ingestion) → **LlamaIndex gives leverage**.

Think of it like this:

* **ChromaDB-only** = lean, focused, less moving parts (perfect MVP).
* **ChromaDB + LlamaIndex** = scalable, flexible, multi-source platform (enterprise product).

---

✅ **Answer in one line:**
Yes, you can achieve your **entire MVP just with ChromaDB**. LlamaIndex is only needed later if you want to scale into multi-source, complex retrieval territory.

---

Do you want me to also contrast the same way for **LangGraph** (why optional vs when necessary)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect — let’s do the same breakdown for **LangGraph** 🚀

---

## 🔹 What LangGraph Brings

**LangGraph** is a framework for building **stateful, multi-step agent workflows**.

* Lets you chain together multiple tools (LLM, SQL runner, retriever, Python functions).
* Maintains **state + memory** across steps (so the agent “remembers” context).
* Supports **branches, retries, error handling** in a graph-like structure.
* Good for **complex reasoning** (multi-hop queries, workflow automation).

👉 In short: **LangGraph = orchestration for complex AI workflows**.

---

## 🔹 What You Get Without LangGraph

If you don’t use it, and just stick to:

* **LLM → SQL → Run → Display** → that’s already fine for:

  * Simple Q\&A
  * Dashboards
  * Scheduled reports

This covers 80% of what your ops users need.
And you can still “fake chaining” by writing Python functions that call one after another.

---

## 🔹 When LangGraph Becomes Valuable

* **Complex multi-step reasoning**:

  * “Get all fails today → filter by counterparties with rating < BBB → calculate net exposure → show trend vs last week.”
  * This might require **multiple SQL queries + aggregation logic**.

* **Tool orchestration**:

  * SQL DB + Excel parser + API call (e.g., FX rates API for settlement amounts).
  * LLM decides which tool to call first.

* **Human-in-the-loop workflows**:

  * “AI suggests query → user approves → AI runs it → result stored.”
  * LangGraph makes it easy to pause/await approval.

* **Error handling & fallbacks**:

  * If SQL fails, re-try with corrected query.
  * If LLM output is wrong type, route to validator.

---

## 🔹 Why I Called It “Optional”

* For your **MVP** (Ops Copilot with MS SQL + dashboards + scheduled reports), **you don’t need LangGraph**.
* You can implement the whole flow as simple Python functions chained together.
* LangGraph only shines when your workflows:

  * Involve **multiple tools/data sources**
  * Require **complex step-by-step reasoning**
  * Need **robust error handling**

---

## 🔹 Side-by-Side Summary

| Framework      | Optional for MVP? | When Necessary                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LlamaIndex** | ✅ Yes, optional   | When you have **multiple data sources** (SQL + docs + APIs) and need advanced retrieval. |
| **LangGraph**  | ✅ Yes, optional   | When you need **multi-step reasoning, tool orchestration, or error handling**.           |

---

✅ **One-liner takeaway:**
You can launch your **first version without LangGraph** — but if you want to evolve into a **true agent that reasons over multiple data sources and handles workflows**, LangGraph becomes essential.

---

👉 Do you want me to sketch a **phased roadmap** (MVP → Advanced → Enterprise) showing when you’d add **Chroma-only**, then **LlamaIndex**, then **LangGraph**?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great question 🙌 — this is **critical in banking/ops** because if your LLM has *write/delete* access, it’s a **huge risk**. You need **training enforcement + DB security separation** baked into the design.

Let’s break it down:

---

## 🔹 1. Training Enforcement

This is handled at the **app layer (your code + vector DB)**, not the LLM.

* **Enforce schema + glossary ingestion first**

  * When a DB is connected, your system *automatically trains* on:

    * Tables + columns from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.
    * Business glossary (YAML/JSON).
  * If these embeddings are missing, block queries.

* **Whitelist training types**

  * Store metadata tags in ChromaDB (`schema`, `glossary`, `rule`, `custom_query`).
  * Only allow queries if `schema + glossary` exist.

✅ This ensures **minimum context** is always enforced.

---

## 🔹 2. DB Security & Query Safety

You **must not trust the raw SQL** generated by the LLM. Instead:

### a) **Read-Only DB User**

* Create a **dedicated read-only SQL user**.
* Permissions:

  ```sql
  DENY INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON DATABASE::YourDB TO [LLMUser];
  GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA::dbo TO [LLMUser];
  ```
* That way, even if LLM “hallucinates” a `DROP TABLE trades`, it will fail.

---

### b) **SQL Validator (App Layer)**

Before executing SQL:

* Parse query (using `sqlparse` or `sqlglot`).
* Reject if it contains:

  * `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE`.
  * `EXEC` or stored procedure calls.

Example:

```python
import sqlparse

def validate_sql(query: str) -> bool:
    forbidden = {"INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE", "DROP", "ALTER", "TRUNCATE", "EXEC"}
    parsed = sqlparse.parse(query)[0]
    tokens = [t.value.upper() for t in parsed.tokens if not t.is_whitespace]
    return not any(cmd in tokens for cmd in forbidden)

sql = "DROP TABLE trades"
if not validate_sql(sql):
    raise Exception("❌ Unsafe SQL detected")
```

---

### c) **Sandbox Query Execution**

* Execute queries **only on a reporting replica / data warehouse**, not the live trading DB.
* This prevents load issues and security breaches.

---

## 🔹 3. Security Controls Beyond SQL

* **Row-level security**: Ensure users only see data relevant to them (e.g., one desk shouldn’t see another’s trades).
* **Audit Logs**: Log every NL input, generated SQL, execution time, and result metadata.
* **Masked Columns**: Hide sensitive fields (client PII, trader IDs) in the SELECT layer.
* **Encryption in transit**: Always use TLS for DB + LLM connections.

---

## 🔹 4. Who Handles What?

| Responsibility                         | Tech / Component                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Training enforcement**               | Your **vector DB logic (ChromaDB)** + app layer checks. |
| **DB read-only access**                | SQL Server permissions (read-only login).               |
| **SQL validation (no writes/deletes)** | Python app layer (sqlparse/sqlglot checks).             |
| **Sandbox execution**                  | Connect to **reporting replica**, not production DB.    |
| **Audit + compliance**                 | App layer logging + SQL audit tables.                   |

---

✅ **Final Takeaway:**

* **Training enforcement** → handled in your app (via ChromaDB + enforcement logic).
* **DB security** → handled by **SQL Server permissions (read-only user)** + **your SQL validator**.
* This way the LLM can only **read data**, never write/delete.

---

👉 Do you want me to sketch a **security flow diagram** (User → LLM → SQL Validator → Read-Only DB → Results → Audit Log) so it’s crystal clear how protections fit together?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent question 👌 — because what you’re building is *not generic “doc Q\&A RAG”* (like chat over PDFs), but a **specialized form of RAG for databases**. Let’s break it down:

---

## 🔹 What RAG Usually Means

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** =

1. **Retrieve** → Get relevant context (from docs, DB schema, etc.) based on user’s query.
2. **Augment** → Feed that retrieved context into the LLM along with the user’s NL question.
3. **Generate** → LLM generates an answer (SQL, text, chart code, etc.).

---

## 🔹 What RAG Looks Like in *Your Case*

You’re not retrieving “long text documents.” Instead, your **retrieval corpus** =

1. **Database Schema**

   * Tables, columns, relationships (via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`).
   * Example chunk: `"Table: trades | Columns: trade_id, trade_date, counterparty, product, amount"`

2. **Business Glossary / Rules**

   * E.g., `"STP = Straight Through Processing, flag column is stp_flag"`.
   * `"Fails = status = 'FAILED'"`.

3. **Custom Queries / Training Examples**

   * Example:

     * NL: “Show all unconfirmed trades”
     * SQL: `SELECT * FROM trades WHERE confirmed=0`

👉 This is sometimes called **Schema+Glossary RAG** or **NL2SQL RAG**.

---

## 🔹 Type of RAG Being Used

This is best described as:

**Structured RAG** (vs Document RAG)

* **Retriever** = Vector DB (ChromaDB), indexing schema + glossary + examples.
* **Augmentation** = At runtime, retrieve the *most relevant schema chunks* + rules.
* **Generation** = LLM uses that retrieved context to generate SQL.

So it’s not free-form “summarize a PDF” RAG, it’s:

* Retrieval from **structured metadata** (schema, rules, examples).
* Generation of **structured output** (SQL).

---

## 🔹 Example Flow in Your Solution

**User:** “Show me today’s settlement fails by currency.”

**Step 1 – Retrieve**
Chroma finds:

* Schema: `settlements(currency, settle_date, status)`
* Glossary: “Fails = status = 'FAILED'”
* Example: `"today = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)"`

**Step 2 – Augment**
LLM prompt includes:

```
User Question: Show me today’s settlement fails by currency.
Schema Info: settlements(currency, settle_date, status)
Glossary: Fails = status = 'FAILED'
Business Example: Today = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)
```

**Step 3 – Generate**
LLM outputs SQL:

```sql
SELECT currency, COUNT(*) AS fails
FROM settlements
WHERE settle_date = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)
  AND status='FAILED'
GROUP BY currency;
```

---

## 🔹 Why This Works Well for You

* The RAG is **constrained** → LLM doesn’t hallucinate random tables/columns.
* It ensures **consistency** → same terms (STP, fails, netting) always map correctly.
* It’s **lightweight** → no need for a giant framework like LlamaIndex (unless you add docs/APIs).

---

✅ **Answer in one line:**
You are using **Structured RAG for NL2SQL**, where the retriever (ChromaDB) stores schema, glossary, and query examples, and the generator (LLM) uses this retrieved context to produce safe, accurate SQL.

---

👉 Do you want me to also compare this **Structured RAG** approach with **Knowledge Graph RAG** (graph-based retrieval) so you see if banks with 100s of tables might benefit from that later?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect 🙌 — let’s dive into **two things**:

1. Comparing your current **Structured RAG** with a possible **Graph-based RAG**
2. Explaining **context chunking** specifically for *schemas + glossary*

---

# 1️⃣ Structured RAG vs Graph RAG

### 🔹 Structured RAG (what you’re doing now)

* Store schema info, glossary, and query examples in **flat vector embeddings** (ChromaDB).
* At query time, retrieve **most relevant chunks** (e.g., related table + columns).
* Pass them into LLM prompt.

✅ Good for:

* Small to medium databases.
* Single schema (OTC trades + settlements).
* Direct NL → SQL mapping.

❌ Limitations:

* With **100s of tables**, embeddings may not capture relationships well.
* Complex joins (e.g., trades → allocations → cashflows → settlements) might get missed.

---

### 🔹 Graph-based RAG (possible evolution)

* Represent DB schema as a **knowledge graph**:

  * Nodes = tables, columns, glossary terms.
  * Edges = relationships (foreign keys, business mappings).
* Retrieval is not just **nearest neighbor** from vectors, but also **graph traversal**.
* LLM sees both:

  * Relevant table chunks.
  * Their **relationships** (e.g., *settlements.currency → trades.currency*).

✅ Good for:

* Very large + complex schemas.
* Multi-hop questions (fail → counterparty → netting group).
* Avoiding hallucination (LLM “walks” the graph).

❌ Tradeoff:

* Heavier infra (graph DB like Neo4j, or LlamaIndex Graph Index).
* Overkill for small schemas.

---

**Summary:**

* **Structured RAG** = simpler, embedding-based, enough for MVP.
* **Graph RAG** = future option when schema complexity explodes.

---

# 2️⃣ Context Chunking in Your Case

In doc-based RAG (like PDFs), chunking means **splitting text into smaller pieces** (e.g., paragraphs).
In *schema RAG*, chunking is different: you chunk **schema + glossary metadata**.

---

### 🔹 Types of Chunks You’ll Store

1. **Table-level chunks**

   ```
   Table: trades
   Columns: trade_id, trade_date, product_type, counterparty_id, notional, currency
   ```

2. **Column-level chunks (for critical tables)**

   ```
   Column: counterparty_id
   Description: Unique ID for counterparty, joins to counterparties table
   ```

3. **Relationship chunks**

   ```
   Relationship: trades.counterparty_id → counterparties.counterparty_id
   ```

4. **Glossary chunks**

   ```
   Term: STP (Straight Through Processing)
   Definition: A trade is STP if stp_flag=1
   ```

5. **Query Example chunks**

   ```
   Example:
   NL: Show all failed settlements
   SQL: SELECT * FROM settlements WHERE status='FAILED';
   ```

---

### 🔹 How Retrieval Works with Chunking

When user asks:

> “Show STP fails by counterparty today”

Retriever (ChromaDB) pulls these chunks:

* `Glossary: STP = stp_flag=1`
* `Glossary: Fails = status='FAILED'`
* `Table: settlements(currency, status, settle_date, counterparty_id)`
* `Relationship: settlements.counterparty_id → counterparties.counterparty_id`
* `Table: counterparties(counterparty_id, name)`

LLM prompt now contains **exact chunks**, so it can generate:

```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(*) AS fails
FROM settlements s
JOIN counterparties c ON s.counterparty_id = c.counterparty_id
WHERE s.stp_flag=1
  AND s.status='FAILED'
  AND s.settle_date=CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)
GROUP BY c.name;
```

---

### 🔹 Why Chunking Matters Here

* Prevents **context overflow** (don’t dump entire schema → too big for LLM).
* Ensures **precision** (LLM sees *only relevant tables + glossary*).
* Allows **scalability** (with 100+ tables, only 5–6 chunks get retrieved).

---

✅ **Final Answer:**

* You’re currently using **Structured RAG with embedding-based chunk retrieval**.
* If schema complexity grows, you can evolve to **Graph RAG** for relationship-aware retrieval.
* Chunking in your case means **splitting schema, glossary, relationships, and examples** into retrievable “knowledge bites” that LLM uses at runtime.

---

👉 Do you want me to draft a **sample schema-to-chunking pipeline** (Python pseudocode) showing how you’d auto-extract tables/columns from MS SQL and turn them into chunks for Chroma?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excellent — you’ve spotted the **real secret sauce**:
👉 *Schema alone isn’t enough* — the **business logic behind the schema** (what tables mean, how fields are used, what rules apply) is what makes the LLM generate *useful and accurate SQL*.

Let’s break it down:

---

# 🔹 Where Business Logic Lives in Your RAG

1. **Glossary Chunks (Business Definitions)**

   * Store **business terms → SQL mappings**.
   * Example:

     ```
     Term: STP
     Definition: Straight Through Processing
     SQL Logic: stp_flag = 1
     ```

     ```
     Term: Fails
     Definition: A failed settlement
     SQL Logic: status = 'FAILED'
     ```

   🔑 Purpose: If a user asks “show STP trades,” LLM maps it to the **right column filter**, not just guess.

---

2. **Relationship Chunks (Business Joins)**

   * Store **how tables relate in business terms**, not just FK.
   * Example:

     ```
     Relationship: settlements.counterparty_id → counterparties.counterparty_id
     Business Meaning: Each settlement belongs to a counterparty
     ```

   🔑 Purpose: LLM doesn’t hallucinate joins — it knows *why* tables connect.

---

3. **Rule Chunks (Derived Fields & Metrics)**

   * Store reusable **business formulas**.
   * Example:

     ```
     Metric: Net Exposure
     SQL Logic: SUM(trades.notional * trades.fx_rate) - SUM(collateral.amount)
     ```

   🔑 Purpose: If ops ask “What is today’s net exposure?”, LLM plugs in **business-approved formula**, not a random sum.

---

4. **Example Query Chunks (NL → SQL Pairs)**

   * Store **canonical examples** of NL → SQL.
   * Example:

     ```
     NL: Show unconfirmed trades today
     SQL: SELECT * FROM trades WHERE confirmed=0 AND trade_date=CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)
     ```

   🔑 Purpose: Fine-tunes the LLM’s “style” and improves consistency.

---

# 🔹 Where Do We Store Business Logic?

* **Vector DB (Chroma)** → store each of these chunks as embeddings for retrieval.
* **Metadata Fields** → tag chunks by type (`schema`, `glossary`, `relationship`, `rule`, `example`).
* **Versioned Store (DB/JSON/YAML)** → keep a master copy of business rules for auditability.

  * Example: A YAML file per domain:

    ```yaml
    terms:
      STP: stp_flag = 1
      Fails: status = 'FAILED'
    metrics:
      NetExposure: SUM(trades.notional * trades.fx_rate) - SUM(collateral.amount)
    joins:
      settlements_to_counterparties: settlements.counterparty_id = counterparties.counterparty_id
    ```

👉 On app startup → ingest this YAML into Chroma as retrievable chunks.

---

# 🔹 How Business Logic Improves SQL Accuracy

Without business logic:

* LLM sees only raw schema → `settlements(status, stp_flag, settle_date)`
* Query: “Show today’s STP fails” → LLM might miss logic, guess wrong filters.

With business logic chunks:

* Retriever feeds:

  * Glossary: STP = stp\_flag=1
  * Glossary: Fails = status=’FAILED’
  * Schema: settlements table (status, stp\_flag, settle\_date)

LLM generates:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM settlements
WHERE stp_flag=1
  AND status='FAILED'
  AND settle_date=CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE);
```

👉 Much more accurate, because it “knows” the **business mappings**.

---

✅ **Final Takeaway:**

* Business logic is stored as **glossary, rules, relationships, and examples** in your RAG index (Chroma).
* This tells the LLM **how to interpret schema fields in business terms**.
* Result = **fewer hallucinations, higher accuracy, consistent outputs across users**.

---

👉 Do you want me to sketch a **data model for the business logic store** (tables or JSON schema) so you know exactly how to structure and ingest these rules?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

308 tables 😮 — thanks, that changes the game quite a bit. Let’s think this through.

---

# 🔹 Why 308 Tables is a Challenge

* **Schema size**: dumping the whole schema into an LLM context won’t work (too big).
* **Complex joins**: many ops questions (e.g., “failed trades by product by counterparty”) will span multiple tables.
* **Ambiguity**: same column names in multiple tables (e.g., `status`, `date`) — LLM will confuse them.
* **User trust**: ops users will stop using the tool if queries are wrong/slow.

---

# 🔹 How to Handle a 308-Table Schema

### 1. **Chunked Schema Indexing**

Instead of one “giant schema chunk”, we break it into:

* **Table-level chunks** (name + columns + short description).
* **Relationship chunks** (FK + business meaning).
* **Business glossary chunks** (trade fails, STP, netting, etc).
* **Query examples** (high-frequency ops queries).

👉 Retrieval ensures **only relevant 5–10 chunks** go to LLM, not all 308 tables.

---

### 2. **Business Logic Layer (Mandatory)**

We can’t rely on schema alone. You’ll need a **domain glossary** like:

```yaml
terms:
  STP: stp_flag = 1
  Fails: status = 'FAILED'
  Unconfirmed Trade: confirmed = 0
metrics:
  Net Exposure: SUM(trades.notional * trades.fx_rate) - SUM(collateral.amount)
joins:
  settlements_to_counterparties: settlements.counterparty_id = counterparties.counterparty_id
  trades_to_cashflows: trades.trade_id = cashflows.trade_id
```

👉 LLM retrieves these rules along with schema so queries are **business-correct**.

---

### 3. **Hierarchical RAG (Multi-stage retrieval)**

For 308 tables, a **single embedding search** won’t be enough.
We can use a **2-step retrieval**:

1. First, retrieve **relevant tables** for the NL query.
2. Then, fetch **columns + rules** for only those tables.

👉 This keeps context small and precise.

---

### 4. **Query Validation & Safety**

* All queries must run on **read-only SQL replica**.
* Add a **SQL validator** to check:

  * Only `SELECT` allowed
  * Joins are valid
  * No cross-schema access without rules

---

### 5. **Example-driven training (per domain)**

With 308 tables, ops won’t trust NL2SQL unless it **consistently matches how ops already query**.
We should build a **library of sample NL → SQL pairs** (like “Top 50 most common queries”).

👉 This acts as **ground truth**, improves retrieval & accuracy.

---

# 🔹 Tech Implications for 308-Table DB

* **RAG type**: Structured RAG (ChromaDB) with **hierarchical retrieval**.
* **Chunking**: schema → table chunks, column chunks, relationship chunks, business rules, examples.
* **LLM**: needs structured prompting (few-shot with business examples).
* **Optional Enhancements**:

  * **LlamaIndex** → easier multi-source retrieval.
  * **LangGraph** → multi-step reasoning (if queries span 4–5 joins).
  * **Graph DB (Neo4j)** → only if joins become too complex for embeddings.

---

✅ **Bottom line**:
Vanna (or your OTC Ops Copilot) *can handle 308 tables*, but **not out-of-the-box**. You’ll need:

* A **business glossary + rules layer**
* **Hierarchical retrieval** (not single embedding search)
* **Strict query validation**
* **Top 50 example queries** for fine-tuned accuracy

---

👉 Do you want me to draft a **scalable chunking strategy** (how we’d split 308 tables into retrievable chunks for ChromaDB), so you can see what the data model looks like?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect 👌 you’re asking exactly the right things. Let’s design this **scalable strategy** so your tool can handle 308 tables and still remain accurate + ops-user friendly.

---

# 🔹 Chunking Strategy for 308 Tables

We’ll build **retrievable chunks** that represent *different types of knowledge* about the database. Each chunk type is stored in **ChromaDB** (or another vector DB), tagged with metadata so retrieval knows what’s what.

---

## 1. **Schema Chunks**

* Each table = one chunk.
* Includes: table name, description, and columns (with types).
* Example:

```json
{
  "type": "schema",
  "table": "settlements",
  "description": "Trade settlement details",
  "columns": {
    "settlement_id": "Primary key",
    "trade_id": "References trades table",
    "counterparty_id": "References counterparties",
    "status": "SETTLED, FAILED, PENDING",
    "stp_flag": "1 = Straight Through Processing, 0 = Manual"
  }
}
```

✅ Stored in **ChromaDB embeddings** with `type=schema`.

---

## 2. **Business Glossary + Rules Layer**

* This is the “ops knowledge” — rules, definitions, metrics.
* Stored as **text chunks** and tagged as `type=glossary`.
* Example:

```json
{
  "type": "glossary",
  "term": "STP",
  "definition": "Straight Through Processing, trades auto-confirmed without manual intervention",
  "sql_mapping": "stp_flag = 1"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "rule",
  "metric": "Net Exposure",
  "logic": "SUM(trades.notional * trades.fx_rate) - SUM(collateral.amount)"
}
```

✅ Stored in **ChromaDB**. Also keep a **master YAML/JSON** (version-controlled) for audit + easy updates.

---

## 3. **Relationship Chunks (Joins)**

* Needed so LLM doesn’t hallucinate joins.
* Example:

```json
{
  "type": "relationship",
  "from_table": "settlements",
  "to_table": "counterparties",
  "join": "settlements.counterparty_id = counterparties.counterparty_id",
  "business_meaning": "Each settlement belongs to a counterparty"
}
```

✅ Stored in **ChromaDB**. Retrieved when query spans multiple tables.

---

## 4. **Example Queries (Top 50)**

* These are the **“golden set” of NL → SQL pairs**.
* Used as few-shot examples during SQL generation.
* Example:

```json
{
  "type": "example_query",
  "natural_language": "Show unconfirmed trades today",
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM trades WHERE confirmed=0 AND trade_date=CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)"
}
```

✅ Stored in **ChromaDB** but also in a **separate curated repo** (e.g., YAML/JSON file).

# 🔹 Hierarchical Retrieval Strategy

When user asks:

> “Show STP fails by counterparty this week”

1. **Step 1 → Identify Relevant Tables**
   Retrieve from ChromaDB → `settlements`, `counterparties`.

2. **Step 2 → Pull Business Glossary/Rules**
   Fetch:

   * STP → `stp_flag=1`
   * Fails → `status='FAILED'`

3. **Step 3 → Pull Relationships**
   `settlements.counterparty_id = counterparties.counterparty_id`

4. **Step 4 → Add Example Queries**
   Retrieve “show unconfirmed trades today” → helps SQL formatting.

5. **Step 5 → LLM Generates SQL**

```sql
SELECT c.counterparty_name, COUNT(*) AS failed_trades
FROM settlements s
JOIN counterparties c ON s.counterparty_id = c.counterparty_id
WHERE s.stp_flag=1
  AND s.status='FAILED'
  AND s.settle_date >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE))
GROUP BY c.counterparty_name;
```

---

# 🔹 Strict Query Validation (Where it Fits)

* After SQL generation → **Python middleware** checks:

  * Query starts with `SELECT`
  * No `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `DROP`
  * Tables exist in schema index
  * Joins are valid (match relationship rules)
* If invalid → reject with error OR re-prompt LLM.

---

✅ This way:

* **ChromaDB** = brain (schema + rules + examples)
* **YAML/JSON repo** = audit + version control for business rules
* **Middleware** = query safety net

---

Do you want me to **draft the JSON/YAML schema template** for these chunks (so you can start populating glossary, rules, relationships, and example queries right away)?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Excellent catch 🙌 — **master/reference tables** (statuses, event types, trade types, etc.) are absolutely critical in ops workflows, because without them the LLM won’t know what values mean.

Let’s break it down:

---

# 🔹 Why Master Tables Matter

* Schema tells us a column name: `status VARCHAR(20)`
* But **it doesn’t explain the possible values** (`FAILED`, `SETTLED`, `PENDING`).
* Ops terms like “Fails” → really map to `status='FAILED'`.
* Without master values, the LLM may hallucinate (e.g., guess `status='ERROR'`).

---

# 🔹 Where to Store Master Table Knowledge

We need to treat them like **business glossary extensions**.

### 1. **Reference Data Chunks (in ChromaDB)**

Each master table entry stored as a retrievable chunk:

```json
{
  "type": "reference_data",
  "table": "settlements",
  "column": "status",
  "value": "FAILED",
  "meaning": "Trade failed during settlement"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "reference_data",
  "table": "settlements",
  "column": "status",
  "value": "SETTLED",
  "meaning": "Trade successfully settled"
}
```

👉 These chunks are retrieved when LLM sees a user query containing terms like *fails, settled trades*.

---

### 2. **Master Dictionary File (YAML/JSON for audit)**

Keep a **version-controlled file** that mirrors the master data:

```yaml
reference_data:
  settlements.status:
    - value: FAILED
      meaning: Trade failed during settlement
    - value: SETTLED
      meaning: Trade successfully settled
    - value: PENDING
      meaning: Trade pending confirmation
  trades.trade_type:
    - value: IRS
      meaning: Interest Rate Swap
    - value: FXFWD
      meaning: FX Forward
    - value: CDS
      meaning: Credit Default Swap
```

👉 This file ensures ops + compliance can **sign off on definitions**.

---

### 3. **Dynamic Sync (Optional)**

If master tables change frequently (new statuses, new event types):

* Build a **sync job** (Python ETL) that:

  * Pulls master table data from DB daily
  * Updates both **ChromaDB embeddings** and the **YAML file**

👉 Ensures LLM always uses the latest values.

---

# 🔹 How It Helps in Query Generation

Example query:

> “Show number of failed trades last week”

Retriever fetches:

* Schema chunk → `settlements(status, settle_date, …)`
* Glossary → “Fails = status=FAILED”
* Reference data → `status` valid values: FAILED, SETTLED, PENDING

LLM builds safe SQL:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS failed_trades
FROM settlements
WHERE status = 'FAILED'
  AND settle_date >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE));
```

👉 No hallucinations like `status='ERROR'` because reference data chunk told it the allowed values.

---

# 🔹 Where Everything Lives (Extended View)

| Knowledge Type            | Stored In ChromaDB? | Also Stored in YAML/JSON (Audit)?      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Schema (tables + columns) | ✅ Yes               | ❌ (schema comes from DB introspection) |
| Business glossary + rules | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                                  |
| Relationships (joins)     | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                                  |
| Example queries           | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                                  |
| Master/reference data     | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes (kept in sync)                   |

---

✅ **Summary**:

* Master/reference tables should be **chunked into ChromaDB** just like glossary/rules.
* Also stored in a **curated YAML/JSON dictionary** for audit + signoff.
* Optional daily sync job ensures LLM context is always fresh.

---

👉 Do you want me to draft a **sample YAML schema** that combines glossary, rules, relationships, *and* master/reference data — so you have one master structure to maintain?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Fantastic point 🙌 — you’re thinking beyond just “schema” into **database logic** (constraints, triggers, DDL). This is *super relevant* in ops-heavy databases because a lot of the “business rules” are actually encoded in the DB itself.

Let’s break it down:

---

# 🔹 Why Triggers, Constraints, and CREATE Statements Matter

1. **Constraints (PK/FK, CHECK, UNIQUE)**

   * Define *valid relationships* (e.g., `settlements.trade_id → trades.trade_id`).
   * Define *valid values* (e.g., `CHECK(status IN ('FAILED','SETTLED'))`).
   * Help prevent hallucinations when generating joins or filters.

2. **Triggers**

   * Often used to enforce business processes (e.g., *auto-update settlement status on trade confirmation*).
   * Useful for **business glossary** because they tell you “what happens automatically.”

3. **CREATE Statements (DDL)**

   * Contain the **full definition of schema**.
   * This is the most reliable way to embed **all structural info** into the retriever, instead of relying on ad-hoc descriptions.

---

# 🔹 Where Do We Store Them?

### 1. **Constraints & Joins**

* Extract from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` or directly from `CREATE TABLE`.
* Store as **relationship chunks** in ChromaDB:

```json
{
  "type": "constraint",
  "table": "settlements",
  "column": "counterparty_id",
  "references": "counterparties.counterparty_id",
  "business_meaning": "Each settlement belongs to one counterparty"
}
```

👉 This replaces guesswork with **real DB constraints**.

---

### 2. **Check Constraints & Defaults**

* Store as **reference/rules chunks**.
* Example:

```json
{
  "type": "constraint",
  "table": "settlements",
  "column": "status",
  "check": "status IN ('FAILED','SETTLED','PENDING')",
  "business_meaning": "Settlement status can only be one of the defined values"
}
```

---

### 3. **Triggers**

* Triggers are not used in queries directly, but they encode **business flows**.
* We store them in **glossary/rules** layer:

```json
{
  "type": "trigger",
  "name": "update_settlement_status",
  "event": "AFTER INSERT ON trades",
  "action": "Updates settlements.status to 'PENDING'",
  "business_meaning": "New trades auto-create pending settlements"
}
```

👉 When LLM sees “new trades → pending settlements”, it understands the ops logic.

---

### 4. **CREATE TABLE Statements (DDL)**

* Best practice: extract raw `CREATE TABLE` SQL and chunk it.
* Store in ChromaDB as **schema chunks**, so LLM sees full detail.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE settlements (
    settlement_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    trade_id INT NOT NULL,
    counterparty_id INT NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('FAILED','SETTLED','PENDING')),
    stp_flag BIT DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (trade_id) REFERENCES trades(trade_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (counterparty_id) REFERENCES counterparties(counterparty_id)
);
```

Stored as:

```json
{
  "type": "ddl",
  "table": "settlements",
  "statement": "CREATE TABLE settlements ( ... )"
}
```

---

# 🔹 Retrieval Flow With Constraints/Triggers

Example question:

> “Show failed settlements for counterparties who didn’t have STP trades”

Retriever pulls:

* Schema chunks → `settlements`, `counterparties`
* Constraint chunks → valid joins (`settlements.counterparty_id = counterparties.counterparty_id`)
* Reference chunks → `status IN ('FAILED','SETTLED','PENDING')`
* Rule chunk → `stp_flag=1`
* Example query → “unconfirmed trades today”

LLM produces **accurate SQL** with correct joins + values.

---

# 🔹 Storage Recap

| Knowledge Type           | Where Stored                 | Example Use           |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Schema (CREATE)**      | ChromaDB (`type=ddl`)        | Full table definition |
| **Constraints (FK, PK)** | ChromaDB (`type=constraint`) | Accurate joins        |
| **Check constraints**    | ChromaDB (`type=constraint`) | Valid values          |
| **Triggers**             | ChromaDB (`type=trigger`)    | Business flows        |
| **Business glossary**    | ChromaDB + YAML              | Ops definitions       |
| **Master data**          | ChromaDB + YAML              | Status/event mappings |

---

✅ **Summary**:

* We embed **CREATE TABLE** + **constraints** + **triggers** into ChromaDB.
* They act as a **guardrail layer** → ensures SQL is valid, joins are correct, and values are consistent.
* Combined with **example queries + glossary**, this makes NL2SQL robust even in a 308-table DB.

---

👉 Do you want me to draft a **unified YAML/JSON schema template** that covers:

* Schema (DDL)
* Constraints
* Triggers
* Business glossary
* Master/reference data
* Example queries

so you can maintain **one master knowledge file** and feed it into ChromaDB?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect 👌 Let’s design a **unified YAML schema template** that you can use as a **single source of truth** for:

* Schema (DDL)
* Constraints
* Triggers
* Business glossary
* Master/reference data
* Example queries

This file can be **checked into Git** (version controlled), reviewed by ops teams, and used to **populate ChromaDB**.

    business_meaning: "Each settlement belongs to one counterparty"

  - table: settlements
    column: trade_id

  - natural_language: "List failed settlements by counterparty this week"
    sql: |
      SELECT c.counterparty_name, COUNT(*) AS failed_trades
      FROM settlements s
      JOIN counterparties c
        ON s.counterparty_id = c.counterparty_id
      WHERE s.status = 'FAILED'
        AND s.settle_date >= DATEADD(DAY, -7, CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE))
      GROUP BY c.counterparty_name;
```

---

# 🔹 How You’ll Use This

1. **Version control**

   * Store `knowledge_base.yaml` in Git → Ops + IT can review changes.

2. **Load into ChromaDB**

   * Parse YAML → create embeddings for each `schema`, `constraint`, `trigger`, `glossary`, `reference_data`, `example_query`.
   * Store with metadata (`type=schema`, `type=constraint`, etc.).

3. **RAG Retrieval**

   * When a query comes in, retriever pulls:

     * Relevant schema chunks
     * Constraints for joins
     * Glossary/rules for business terms
     * Reference data for valid values
     * Example queries for few-shot learning

4. **Middleware validation**

   * Generated SQL is cross-checked against this YAML (e.g., check if `status='FAILED'` is valid).

---

✅ This way, you get:

* **One file → multiple knowledge layers** (schema, rules, examples).
* **Auditability** → Ops can review & sign off.
* **Traceability** → If query is wrong, you know which chunk needs updating.

---

👉 Do you want me to also design a **Python loader function** that takes this YAML file and pushes all chunks into ChromaDB automatically (with type-based metadata)?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it ✅ — now that we’ve explored **Vanna’s core code**, the **Streamlit app**, and your **target stack** (MS SQL + ChromaDB + in-house LLM), I’ll design a **clean project structure** for your OTC Ops Copilot.

This structure combines only the **essential files** from:

* **Vanna Core** (NL → SQL engine logic)
* **Streamlit UI** (user interface)
* Your new modules (**ChromaDB retriever**, **in-house LLM connector**, **YAML knowledge loader**)

* `run.py`: CLI entrypoint (`python run.py`) to:

  * Load knowledge base → ChromaDB
  * Start backend engine
  * Launch Streamlit frontend

---

✅ This gives you a **lean, production-ready structure**.
Everything unnecessary from Vanna’s repo (extras, connectors you don’t need, docs, etc.) is stripped away.

---

👉 Do you want me to also create a **requirements.txt draft** with only the needed dependencies for this cleaned-up version?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect 👍 Let’s create a **lean `requirements.txt`** tailored for your OTC Ops Copilot (with Streamlit frontend, MS SQL backend, ChromaDB retriever, and in-house LLM connector).

⚡️ This is much lighter than Vanna’s full dependency list — only what’s needed for your **custom OTC Copilot**.

👉 Do you also want me to make a **`run.py` bootstrap script** that:

1. Loads `knowledge_base.yaml` into ChromaDB
2. Starts the backend engine
3. Launches Streamlit automatically?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Awesome 🚀 Let’s build a **minimal bootstrap script** (`run.py`) that:

1. Loads your `knowledge_base.yaml` into **ChromaDB**
2. Starts the **retriever + engine**
3. Launches the **Streamlit UI**

---

# 📂 run.py

```python
import os
import subprocess
import yaml
from core.retriever import ChromaRetriever
from knowledge.loader import load_knowledge_base
from config import chromadb_config, db_config, llm_config


def bootstrap_chromadb():
    """Load knowledge_base.yaml into ChromaDB"""
    kb_path = os.path.join("knowledge", "knowledge_base.yaml")
    if not os.path.exists(kb_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Knowledge base not found: {kb_path}")

    print("📥 Loading knowledge base into ChromaDB...")
    with open(kb_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        kb = yaml.safe_load(f)

    retriever = ChromaRetriever(persist_directory=chromadb_config["persist_directory"])
    load_knowledge_base(retriever, kb)
    print("✅ Knowledge base loaded into ChromaDB")


def launch_streamlit():
    """Run Streamlit frontend"""
    print("🚀 Launching Streamlit app...")
    subprocess.run(["streamlit", "run", "app/app.py"])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("🔧 Bootstrapping OTC Ops Copilot...")

    # Step 1: Load knowledge into ChromaDB
    bootstrap_chromadb()

    # Step 2: Launch Streamlit UI
    launch_streamlit()
```

---

# 🔹 Supporting Files Needed

### 📂 `knowledge/loader.py`

Handles chunking YAML knowledge into ChromaDB:

```python
def load_knowledge_base(retriever, kb):
    """
    Load schema, glossary, rules, reference data, examples into ChromaDB.
    """
    for section, entries in kb.items():
        if not entries:
            continue
        for key, value in (entries.items() if isinstance(entries, dict) else enumerate(entries)):
            retriever.add_chunk(section, key, value)
```

---

### 📂 `core/retriever.py`

Wrapper for ChromaDB:

```python
import chromadb
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

class ChromaRetriever:
    def __init__(self, persist_directory="chroma_store"):
        self.client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path=persist_directory)
        self.collection = self.client.get_or_create_collection("otc_ops")
        self.model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

    def add_chunk(self, chunk_type, key, value):
        text = f"{chunk_type.upper()} | {key}: {value}"
        embedding = self.model.encode([text])[0].tolist()
        self.collection.add(
            documents=[text],
            embeddings=[embedding],
            metadatas=[{"type": chunk_type}],
            ids=[f"{chunk_type}_{str(key)}"]
        )

    def retrieve(self, query, top_k=5):
        embedding = self.model.encode([query])[0].tolist()
        return self.collection.query(query_embeddings=[embedding], n_results=top_k)
```

---

# 🔹 How You Run It

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

This will:

1. Load your **knowledge\_base.yaml** into ChromaDB
2. Spin up the **retriever + engine**
3. Launch **Streamlit UI** (`app/app.py`) in browser

---

👉 Do you want me to also sketch out what **`app/app.py`** (Streamlit frontend) should look like in this cleaned-up project (query input + results + chart)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Perfect 🙌 Let’s design a clean **Streamlit frontend** (`app/app.py`) that connects to your core engine.
This will let ops users:

1. Enter a natural language question
2. See the generated SQL
3. View query results in a table
4. Visualize results (if numeric/time-series)

---

# 📂 `app/app.py`

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from core.engine import NL2SQLPipeline
from core.visualizer import visualize_results

# Initialize pipeline once
@st.cache_resource
def load_pipeline():
    return NL2SQLPipeline()

pipeline = load_pipeline()

# --- UI ---
st.set_page_config(page_title="OTC Ops Copilot", layout="wide")

st.title("📊 OTC Ops Copilot")
st.markdown("Ask questions about trades, settlements, and confirmations.")

# User input
query = st.text_input("🔍 Enter your question (e.g., 'Show failed settlements by counterparty this week')")

if query:
    with st.spinner("Generating SQL..."):
        try:
            # Step 1: Convert NL → SQL
            sql_query = pipeline.nl_to_sql(query)

            st.subheader("📝 Generated SQL")
            st.code(sql_query, language="sql")

            # Step 2: Run SQL on DB
            df = pipeline.run_sql(sql_query)

            # Step 3: Show table
            st.subheader("📋 Query Results")
            st.dataframe(df, use_container_width=True)

            # Step 4: Visualization (if possible)
            chart = visualize_results(df)
            if chart:
                st.subheader("📈 Visualization")
                st.plotly_chart(chart, use_container_width=True)

        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"⚠️ Error: {str(e)}")
```

# 🔹 Supporting Core Code

### 📂 `core/engine.py`

Pipeline wrapper for retrieval + SQL generation + execution:

```python
from core.retriever import ChromaRetriever
from core.sql_generator import SQLGenerator
from core.sql_validator import SQLValidator
from core.db_connector import DBConnector

class NL2SQLPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.retriever = ChromaRetriever()
        self.sql_gen = SQLGenerator()
        self.validator = SQLValidator()
        self.db = DBConnector()

    def nl_to_sql(self, question: str) -> str:
        # Retrieve context from Chroma
        context = self.retriever.retrieve(question)
        # Generate SQL via LLM
        sql = self.sql_gen.generate(question, context)
        # Validate SQL
        if not self.validator.is_safe(sql):
            raise ValueError("Unsafe SQL detected")
        return sql

    def run_sql(self, sql: str):
        return self.db.query(sql)
```

---

### 📂 `core/visualizer.py`

Auto-generate Plotly chart if data is numeric or time-based:

```python
import plotly.express as px

def visualize_results(df):
    if df is None or df.empty:
        return None

    # Case 1: Time-series
    if "date" in df.columns[0].lower():
        return px.line(df, x=df.columns[0], y=df.columns[1], title="Time Series")

    # Case 2: Grouped data (e.g., by counterparty)
    if df.shape[1] == 2 and df[df.columns[1]].dtype in ["int64", "float64"]:
        return px.bar(df, x=df.columns[0], y=df.columns[1], title="Grouped Data")

    # Fallback
    return None
```

---

# 🔹 User Flow

1. User asks:

   > *“Show failed settlements by counterparty this week”*

2. Pipeline does:

   * Retriever → pulls schema, glossary (`fails=status='FAILED'`)
   * SQL generator → builds SQL
   * Validator → ensures safe SELECT
   * DB connector → runs on MS SQL
   * Results → shown in **table + chart**

---

✅ With this setup, your ops team gets:

* **Trust** (SQL shown before execution)
* **Transparency** (clear mapping of business → SQL)
* **Self-service BI** (query + charts in one UI)

---

👉 Do you also want me to extend this UI to include **saved queries + scheduled reports** (from your Extract Manager idea), or keep it as a simple query interface for now?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Great 🚀 Let’s extend the **Streamlit UI** to include:

1. **Saved Queries (User can save & reload)**
2. **Scheduled Reports (Pick frequency & auto-generate)**

This builds on your **Extract Manager** idea — ops can:

* Run an ad-hoc query
* Save it as a reusable report
* Schedule it (daily/weekly/custom)

# 🔹 Supporting Services

### 📂 `services/scheduler.py`

```python
import json
import os
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler

class SchedulerService:
    def __init__(self, store_path="knowledge/saved_queries.json"):
        self.store_path = store_path
        self.scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()
        self.scheduler.start()
        if not os.path.exists(store_path):
            with open(store_path, "w") as f:
                json.dump([], f)

    def save_query(self, nl, sql):
        with open(self.store_path, "r+") as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            new_entry = {"id": len(data)+1, "nl": nl, "sql": sql}
            data.append(new_entry)
            f.seek(0)
            json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

    def list_queries(self):

        # In production: map frequency → cron
        print(f"Scheduled {query_name} with frequency {frequency}")
        # TODO: Add logic to send report via email/slack
```

---

# 🔹 User Workflow

1. **Ad-hoc Query**

   * User asks → NL2SQL runs → results & chart shown
   * User clicks **Save Query**

2. **Saved Reports Tab**

   * User sees all saved queries
   * Can rerun instantly

3. **Scheduler Tab**

   * Pick a saved query
   * Choose frequency (Daily/Weekly/Custom)
   * Reports get auto-executed → (extend to email/Slack via `notifier.py`)

---

✅ This makes your OTC Copilot not just **interactive**, but also a **reporting platform**.
Ops users can self-serve queries, then automate them without IT help.

---

👉 Do you want me to also extend this with **Email/Slack notifications** (so scheduled reports are pushed to users automatically), or keep scheduling as local runs for now?
